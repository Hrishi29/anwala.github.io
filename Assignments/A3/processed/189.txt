The Atlantic senior editor David Frum sent a tweet Friday night that he quickly removed due to immediate backlash.
Between the fallout of former White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter and the late-breaking news that President Trump has decided to not declassify the Democratic memo in its current form, Frum summarized his take with a rather distasteful tweet.
Frum took down the tweet and followed up with this:
I wasn’t making light of any of today’s heinous events, but enough people say they found the below upsetting that I will take it down. https://t.co/ZhHP47yCiV

“I wasn’t making light of any of today’s heinous events, but enough people say they found the below upsetting that I will take it down,” he tweeted.
Porter stepped down Wednesday after allegations of domestic abuse made by his two ex-wives surfaced and that was followed by the Friday night resignation of speechwriter David Sorensen over his ex-wife’s domestic abuse allegation . And the White House stated that the president was unable to declassify the memo crafted by House Democrats that was meant to counter last week’s release of the GOP memo.

A majority of Americans think that senior federal law enforcement officials may have subverted the law in an attempt to prevent Donald Trump from becoming President of the United States, according to a new poll.
Rasmussen Reports shows that 50 percent of Americans believe it's "likely" that officials broke the law to try keeping Trump out of the White House, including 32 percent who think it's "very likely."
By comparison, 40 percent of Americans believe it's "not likely" that illegal actions from top law enforcement officers happened, with one-quarter of the electorate saying it's "not at all likely."
The shift in public opinion comes amidst a slew of bombshell revelations over the handling of the Clinton email probe and Russia inquiry that rocked the FBI.
More texts between FBI agent Peter Strzok, who was a lead investigator on both the Hillary Clinton email server scandal and the Trump-Russia investigation, and his mistress, FBI lawyer Lisa Page, revealed the depth of their negative feelings towards Trump and Republicans in general.
In addition, the controversial memo written by Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) shocked the country by revealing that the entire Trump-Russia investigation began based on faulty, fabricated evidence that was fed to the FBI by the Clinton campaign.
The FBI has been playing damage control for the last week â€“ but the new Rasmussen poll shows that they're losing the battle to win back the faith and trust of the American people.

The Opening Ceremony acts for âthe Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang have been announced, and they lean toward a distinctly indie rock-slash-folksy vibe with Bolbbalgan4's Ahn Ji Young and Guckkasten's Ha Hyun Woo performing.

That hasn't stopped K-pop fans from buzzing about a possible surprise performance from the biggest K-pop names in the world today.
Dude what if the big thing BTS has prepared for us is that they will sing during the opening ceremony in the Olympics! #BTS #BestBoyBand #iHeartAwards pic.twitter.com/WJdzEdVUX1
Could BTS be a secret guest at the Opening Ceremony? Some fans think it's unlikely because one of their members, Namjoon, had surgery for a deviated septum this week.
so if namjoon had that surgery, it means definitely no bts for the opening ceremony...
Meanwhile, news about potential Closing Ceremony performances has already caused great excitement in K-pop circles.

EXO has experience with sports ceremonies, as member Baekhyun sang the South Korean national anthem for the IOC's opening ceremony. EXO also performed in the opening ceremony for the 2014 Incheon Asia Games.
CL stars in one of K-pop's biggest girl groups, 2NE1, while also doubling as a solo artist who had success in North America with her 2015 jam 'Hello B----es'.
Needless to say, even though CL's performance isn't confirmed, the hype is real. As is the hashtag: #EXOlympics.
Korean broadcasts/news outlets all calling EXO the "representative group of Korea" talking about them performing at the Olympics closing ceremony ðð»ðð»

Doodle Snow Games - Day 2
Welcome to Day 2 of the Doodle Snow Games! On this brrr-eezy day in PyeongChang, we're joined by athletes from all over the world hoping to prove themselves best in class (or species).
Let’s follow Magpie into the rink for a fluttering glimpse of today’s action...
After a slow start in these games, Turtle is determined to curl with the best of them. This amateur turned profe-shell-nel athlete has stepped into the rink sporting a stone-y look of concentration.
We broke the ice with Turtle earlier. “I put my own spin on a classic technique. To take home a win, I just have to stick my neck out — then pull it back in and find a place on the mantle.”
The question is, will that kind of confidence help or herp? Can this slow but steady competitor polish off their rivals to achieve turtle domination over the sport? It’s important to remember, there’s no broom for error in this event. Even the slightest slip-up can plunge you into watery defeat.
...Amazing! Turtle just swept away the competition to slide into first place!
Stop by every day for the next few weeks to keep up with all the action from the Doodle Snow Games!

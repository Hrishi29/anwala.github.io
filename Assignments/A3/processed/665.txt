Assistant US AG: 'When We Fail to Enforce Immigration Laws' It Aids MS-13
Jesse Watters ripped former FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday, suggesting that he "lawyer up" in the wake of new information gleaned from Rep. Devin Nunes' (R-Calif.) FISA memo.
Watters said Democrats like Nunes' committee's number-two, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), "can't address the facts [of the memo and purported use of the unverified Russia dossier] on the merits."
"I don't trust Schiff, he's a proven liar and a leaker," Watters said of the Burbank-area congressman.
He said Comey knew the unverified dossier was full of salacious and questionable information and that the ex-FBI boss even testified before Congress to that extent.
"Comey better lawyer up," Watters said.
Watters said Comey broke the law by presenting the unverified dossier to a FISA judge to obtain a surveillance warrant on Carter Page, a onetime Trump campaign adviser.

"Why did he deliver this unverified dossier to Donald Trump when he knew Hillary [Clinton] paid for it, but didnt tell the president-elect [that] Hillary paid for it?" Watters asked, echoing sentiments made by former Reagan administration official Mark Levin on "Hannity" Monday.
"[Comey] maybe should stop writing his book and lawyer up," Watters remarked.

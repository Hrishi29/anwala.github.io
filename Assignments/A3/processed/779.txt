We call on the U.S. Congress to begin impeachment proceedings against President Trump and Vice President Pence.
Donald Trump has admitted firing FBI Director James Comey to alter an investigation into his campaignâ€™s contacts with Russia, a clear obstruction of justice. Mr. Trump also shared top secret intelligence with foreign adversaries, personally jeopardizing our national security, while Mike Pence has acted as chief accomplice, condoning the misconduct and participating in the cover-up.
This president poses a grave threat to our republic, and we call on you, our elected representatives, to take action.

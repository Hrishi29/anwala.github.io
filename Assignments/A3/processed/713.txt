River Hebert and area news
A curling match at Eglinton castle, Ayrshire, Scotland on February 2, 1860. People have been curling in River Hebert, Nova Scotia since the early 1900s when the Brookside Curling Club was first founded. A new Brookside Curling Club facility was constructed in 1985.
Greetings. In keeping with the sporting spirit of the Sochi Winter Olympic Games, no sport, winter or summer, can rival curling in terms of the longevity and success enjoyed by those curlers connected to River Hebert and its Brookside Curling club.
Over a century ago, the first Brookside Curling club was constructed in River Hebert. In 1985, a new Brookside Curling club was built for curlers to curl in.
A pictorial tour of the Brookside Curling club reveals that Betty Anne Scopie, Nancy Beardsley, Debbie Jackson and Barbara Jane Terrio won a provincial curling championship in 1973, one of several titles won by female teams. In 1969, a men’s team from the Brookside Curling club won the McLellan Cup.
One of our area’s most prolific curlers is Ron Hoeg (Betty Anne’s husband). In a career spanning four decades, Hoeg has won multiple provincial legion curling titles with his twin brother Bob Hoeg at both the open and senior level since 1984.
In January, Brookside Curling club alumnus Peter Beaton, Brandon McLellan and David Quinn, three-fourths of the St. Francis Xavier men’s curling team, continued to defy the odds by competing at Atlantic University play-downs in Fredericton.
In addition, River Hebert’s Reg and Marion Daborn’s 15-year-old granddaughter Janique LeBlanc is part of an accomplished junior girls’ rink that curls out of Chester, Nova Scotia. Most recently, LeBlanc’s team won bronze curling medals.
The aforesaid represents only a sampling of the curling accomplishments that can be attributed to River Hebert curlers and its century-old Brookside Curling club that held their annual Old Souls Bonspiel and silent auction this past weekend.

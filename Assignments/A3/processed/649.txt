A Massachusetts professor is under fire after making a violent comment about President Trump. Barry Bluestone, a professor and political economist, told his class during a public lecture at Northeastern University,
Sometimes I want to just see him impeached other times, quite honestly — I hope there are no FBI agents here — I wouldn’t mind seeing him dead.
Video of the lecture was uploaded to YouTube where it quickly criticized for the violent comment.The university released a statement explaining the statement does "not reflect the views of Northeastern."
The university and its leaders steadfastly oppose violence in all its forms. While faculty members are free to express controversial opinions, the university cannot provide a public platform for comments that could be construed to condone violence. As a result, we have decided to take down the video of this event.”
The video has since been removed. Bluestone has apologized for his comment in a radio interview with Radio Boston . 
I want to apologize, that was not what I meant to say. I’m a person of nonviolence, I’m a Gandhian, and it slipped out. I was just at the end of a two-hour lecture in response to a rather harsh question.
While Bluestone apologized for his comment, he also said he wished the university hadn't taken down the video. He believes the controversy could have been a great starting point for civil discourse.
[The university] took down the video; I wish they hadn’t. We need university administrations that will stand up and say, 'We oppose Bluestone’s words, but now we have understood what Bluestone meant and his apology. Now let’s have a discourse over where is this country, and how do we change it?

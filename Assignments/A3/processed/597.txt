A lot of people couldn’t help but notice the dancers in the middle of the stadium during the Parade of Nations on NBC’s PyeongChang 2018 Olympic Winter Games Opening Ceremony broadcast.
They formed a circle that enclosed the five interlaced Olympic rings in the center of the ceremony’s stage. While athletes from each country walked out to high-energy techno pop music, the dancers kept up their stamina and performed some really cute choreographed moves.
A lot of viewers cheered them on.
Let’s be honest – The stars of the #OpeningCeremony are these dancers (who are probably just moving to stay warm at this point). #Olympics pic.twitter.com/61En2eOpps

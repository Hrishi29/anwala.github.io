Corbett told the Post that Sorensen “ran a car over her foot, put out a cigarette on her hand, threw her into a wall and grasped her menacingly by her hair while they were alone on their boat in remote waters off Maine’s coast, an incident she said left her fearing for her life.”
Trump’s turn back the clock on domestic violence administration is coming unglued. Instead of a house of cards, Trump put together a house of predators, and one by one those predators are being exposed and removed from the White House.

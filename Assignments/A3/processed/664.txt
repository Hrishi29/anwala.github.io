Andrew Janz , a deputy district attorney running against Republican Devin Nunes for Congress, will soon take a leave of absence from the Fresno County District Attorney’s office.
Janz, a Democrat, has saturated national media this week with appearances on CNN, VICE, MSNBC and interviews in a half-dozen online publications after the release of a now-infamous Nunes memo , which accuses the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Department of Justice of acting with political bias during an investigation.
The first-time candidate also has led an exhaustive social media effort aimed at Nunes. He hopes spreading the word will help him overcome the considerable hurdles that come with unseating one of the most visible and well-funded congressional incumbents in the country.
Janz met Wednesday with The Fresno Bee’s editorial board. He was asked when he planned to step away from his duties, given all the time he was apparently spending on the campaign. Janz said he had been taking vacation time here and there to attend campaign events, but he’s also working out a leave of absence with the district attorney’s office to focus on the campaign full-time.

Janz is currently assigned to the violent crimes division. Last year, he secured a high-profile conviction against Kelly Duley , a business owner who was sentenced to 37 years to life in prison for smashing a cocktail glass in a model’s face.

Associate Attorney General Rachel Brand, speaks during a summit to discuss efforts to combat human trafficking, at the Justice Department, on Feb. 2, 2018, in Washington, DC.
Rachel Brand, the Justice Department's third-ranking official, is stepping down to take a job in the private sector.
The Justice Department announced her departure in a statement Friday night and Attorney General Jeff Sessions called Brand "a lawyerâ€™s lawyer."
People in Brand's position, associate attorney general, come and go with little notice. But her planned departure attracted immediate attention, because she is next in line to take over supervision of Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation if Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein were to quit or be fired.
Walmart said in a statement that Brand would serve as executive vice president, global governance and corporate secretary and that she will report to President and CEO Doug McMillon.

TRUMP BUMP: The President’s Approval RATING SOARS In Newest Polls
1 week ago
President Trump’s approval rating continues to rise following his first annual State of the Union address, posting big gains in the wake of the ‘Schumer Shutdown’ and Democrat defeats on budget and immigration issues.
According to the daily Rasmussen tracking poll, the Trump’s approval jumped to 49% this week, beating former President Barack Obama’s numbers at the same time during his first term. The numbers also posted high-marks among those who “strongly approve” of the President’s performance, rising to 35%.
“Since last week’s State of the Union address, Trump’s approval ratings have been running slightly ahead of  where Barack Obama was at this stage of his presidency ,” writes Rasmussen.
More shocking, the poll shows half of Americans believe “senior law enforcement officials” violated the law in order to stop Donald Trump from winning the 2016 presidential election.
The new data comes as the GOP-controlled Congress passed a historic budget agreement, funding the federal government and military for the next two-years.
The President signed the law Friday morning, ending a possible second “Schumer Shutdown.”

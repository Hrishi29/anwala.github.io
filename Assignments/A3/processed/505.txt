President Donald Trump's approval rating is now higher than former President Barack Obama's on the same date of his first term, Rasmussen Reports daily tracking data shows.
In its presidential daily tracking poll released Thursday, the Rasmussen Reports showed Trump's approval at 48 percent, statistically tied with his disapproval rating of 50 percent.
Obama's approval was 46 percent Feb. 8, 2010 , and his disapproval was at 54 percent.
"Given the overwhelmingly negative coverage President Trump has received (in the 90 percent negative range) and the overwhelmingly positive coverage President Obama enjoyed . . . these approval polls reveal a public that has tuned out the mainstream media's nattering against the president," Thomas Lifson wrote for the conservative blog American Thinker .
According to Rasmussen Reports, Trump's disapproval rating — until late last week — has been above 50 percent every day for 10 months. Trump's approval rating Thursday marked the fifth consecutive day it was 48 percent or 49 percent, after sometimes dipping into the 30s.

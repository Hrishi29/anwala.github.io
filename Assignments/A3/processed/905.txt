BACK TO SLIDE
At the White House on Friday, Trump spoke favorably about Porter.
"We wish him well," the president told reporters. "He worked very hard. Found out about it recently and I was surprised by it...Obviously, tough time for him. He did a very good job when he was at the White House."
The president added, "We hope he has a wonderful career...Very sad when we heard about it. He's very sad. He also, as you probably know, he says he's innocent."
The president is also frustrated about Kelly's recent comments that have created headlines â€” including his statement last month that Trump's view on immigration was "evolving" and his widely criticized remark this week that some DREAMers were "too lazy" to sign up for DACA.
Two of the sources said the brewing dissatisfaction has Trump openly musing about potential replacements for the chief of staff job. Inside the West Wing, there's rampant speculation about who those replacements might be.
Among the names being circulated by Trump for chief of staff is current Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney, who also heads the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

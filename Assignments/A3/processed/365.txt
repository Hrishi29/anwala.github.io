Maryland Gov. Posts Selfie Touting Treatment of Second Cancer Case
President Trump told the inspiring story of Sophia Marie Campa-Peters, a nine-year-old girl from Texas who suffers from a rare disease that causes her to have strokes. 
At the National Prayer Breakfast Thursday morning, Trump recalled what Sophia told doctors when they said she may never walk again.
"She replied, 'If you're only going to talk about what I can't do, then I don't want to hear it. Just let me try to walk,'" he said.

"She tried and she succeeded!" Trump told the audience, adding that one of her doctors remarked that "this little girl has God on her side."
Campa-Peters, who was left partially paralyzed by the strokes, and her family were seated in the front row for the speech. Trump said Sophia underwent a high-risk surgery on Jan. 24 and asked people around the world to pray for her, hoping to reach 10,000 people.

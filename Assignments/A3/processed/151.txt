In October 2012, Trump tweeted in response to news that singer Rihanna appeared to be once again romantically paired with Chris Brown after he physically assaulted her.
“If Rihanna is dating Chris Brown again then she has a death wish,” Trump wrote. “A beater is always a beater– just watch!”

Trump is facing quick backlash for comments he made Friday morning praising Porter’s work  and saying he hopes he has “a great career ahead of him.”
“Well, we wish him well. He worked very hard," Trump said.
Porter stepped down Wednesday following news reports that his two ex-wives had accused him of domestic abuse, with one providing photographic evidence.
Porter denied the allegations, which Trump was also quick to point out in his defense of the former staff secretary.
"He says he's innocent, and I think you have to remember that,” Trump said in the Oval Office. “He said very strongly yesterday that he's innocent. So you'll have to talk to him about that. But we absolutely wish him well.”

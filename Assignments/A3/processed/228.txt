A second White House official has resigned amid accusations of domestic violence, according to a report by The Washington Post.
Speechwriter David Sorensen resigned Friday, just days after staff secretary Rob Porter quit amid abuse accusations in two prior marriages.
Sorensen's ex-wife reportedly accused him of being violent and emotionally abusive, which he vehemently denied.
Jessica Corbett described their chaotic marriage to The Post, including allegations that Sorensen ran over her foot with a car, put out a cigarette on her hand and threw her into a wall.
She also gave the newspaper photos of the injuries to her hand from the cigarette, adding she told the FBI about the incidents when they spoke to her about her husband's security clearance.
Sorensen denied the claims and, instead, said he was victim of Corbett's abuse, which he said included fights and punching, according to The Post.
They were reportedly married for more than two years.
Porter resigned Wednesday in the aftermath of his two ex-wives describing his alleged abuse. The reports also included a photo showing one of his exes with a black eye.
Porter also denied the allegations but questions have lingered about why he was able to keep his job even after the allegations reportedly surfaced.

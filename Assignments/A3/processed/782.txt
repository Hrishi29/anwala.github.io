Hartlepool United's winding-up order is being withdrawn after a fundraising campaign set up by a fan successfully paid off their outstanding tax bill.
Hartlepool - up for sale as debts continue to rise - had been issued with a prospective court date as Her Majesty Revenue and Customs [HMRC] looked to recover a payment understood to amount to £48,000.
But that danger has now been averted thanks to the efforts of Pools supporter Rachel Cartwright, who set up a Just Giving page and has handed over the necessary funds to help save the club.
In a statement issued on their official website, Hartlepool confirmed the HMRC debt has been paid and thanked fans for their ongoing support.
It read: "We can confirm that Rachel Cartwright, who set up the Just Giving fundraising page for the Club, has now paid the outstanding HMRC debt.
"HMRC have confirmed that they will cancel the serving of the Winding Up Petition and the process to withdraw the Winding Up order is underway.
"Once again we would like to thank Rachel and all of the fans and community for their generosity of spirit, time and money to support the club."
The appeal page has raised in excess of £84,000, with football fans from around the world contributing towards the effort of saving the club.

Welcome to the official website for Universal Life Church, International  Headquarters
 
The Universal Life Church has no traditional                      doctrine. We as an organization believe in that which is right.                      Each individual has the privilege and responsibility to determine                      what is right for themselves, as long as it does not infringe                      on the rights of others. We do not stand between you and your                      God. We are active advocates of the First Amendment of the                      Constitution of the United States of America.
WE ARE ADVOCATES OF THE GOOD LIFE! We want                      to be competent, to be proficient, to be cooperative, to love                      our fellow man, to appreciate, to be humble, to be honest,                      to be moral, to live positively, to be what we profess.

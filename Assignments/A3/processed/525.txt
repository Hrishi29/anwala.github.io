Origin of the term[ edit ]
Mike Masnick of Techdirt coined [4] the term in 2005 in relation to a holiday resort issuing a takedown notice to urinal.net (a site dedicated to photographs of urinals) over use of the resort's name. [5]
How long is it going to take before lawyers realize that the simple act of trying to repress something they don't like online is likely to make it so that something that most people would never, ever see (like a photo of a urinal in some random beach resort) is now seen by many more people? Let's call it the Streisand Effect. [5]
The term alluded to Barbra Streisand , who had sued photographer Kenneth Adelman and Pictopia.com for violation of privacy. [6] The US$50 million lawsuit endeavored to remove an aerial photograph of Streisand's mansion from the publicly available collection of 12,000 California coastline photographs. [2] [7] [8] Adelman photographed the beachfront property to document coastal erosion as part of the California Coastal Records Project , which was intended to influence government policymakers. [9] [10] Before Streisand filed her lawsuit, "Image 3850" had been downloaded from Adelman's website only six times; two of those downloads were by Streisand's attorneys. [11] As a result of the case, public knowledge of the picture increased exponentially; more than 420,000 people visited the site over the following month. [12] The lawsuit was dismissed and Streisand was ordered to pay Adelman's legal fees, which amounted to $155,567. [13] [14] [15]

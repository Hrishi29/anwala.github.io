The White House has asked the Justice Department to help revise the memo so it can be released, according to the Washington Post.
White House counsel Don McGahn said in a letter to the House Intelligence Committee that the Justice Department believes parts of the memo “would create especially significant concerns for the national security and law enforcement interests,” if released, the Post reported .
Trump will not approve of releasing Dem memo, per person with knowledge. Instead, he will tell legislators that memo needs changes before it could be released.

Trump released the Nunes memo last week, which contained information purporting to show that the FBI and DOJ did not provide complete information when requesting a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court warrant to watch one-time Trump campaign member Carter Page.
The Democrat’s memo, drafted by ranking House Intelligence Committee Democrat Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) , reportedly quashed the claims made by the GOP, showing how the allegations were taken out of context.

The House Intelligence Committee voted Monday, like it did the week before on the Republican memo, to release the Democrats memo. President Donald Trump then had five days to decide whether to release the 10-page document. He did release the GOP memo, over the “concerns” of the FBI and DOJ.

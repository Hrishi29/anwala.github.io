New Zealand snowboarder Carlos Garcia Knight is into the Winter Olympics slopestyle final thanks to a clinical first run.
The 20-year-old was the second-highest scored rider after two runs in the first qualification heat with an 80.1 in PyeongChang on Saturday.
The top six single run scorers from the two heats progress to the final.
Garcia Knight was sixth down the Bokwang Snow Park course and qualified 3.7 points behind Norway's Marcus Kleveland and ahead of Canadian Sebatien Toutant with 78.01.
He failed to land on the fifth section of his second run and was scored 40.2 but maintained his position.
After countryman Tiarn Collins was ruled out of the event through injury, Garcia Knight turned around some poor recent World Cup results to reach the final 12.
He won bronze at his home World Cup event in Cardrona in September but struggled in more recent events in the United States.

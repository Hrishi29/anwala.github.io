Relations between the president and the FBI have declined over the past year amid the ongoing special counsel investigation into Russian election meddling. 
Trump and some Republicans have attacked the FBI and the Justice Department in recent months for their handling of the Moscow probe and the now-closed investigation into former Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton 's private email server.
The president has seized on on uncovered texts between FBI agent Peter Strzok and FBI attorney Lisa Page to depict the agency as prejudiced against him. 
NEW FBI TEXTS ARE BOMBSHELLS!

Trump accused Strzok of "treason" in an interview  last month with The Wall Street Journal, saying he plotted to undermine his candidacy during the 2016 presidential race. 
Late last year, the president said the FBI's reputation "is in tatters — worst in history." 
The Marist poll was conducted from Feb. 5 to 7 among 1,012 adults with a margin of error of 3.7 percentage points.

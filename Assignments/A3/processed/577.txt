Trump on Friday said he would not declassify the memo , which outlines House Intelligence Committee Democrats’ rebuttal to the GOP document that accuses the FBI and Justice Department of surveillance abuses.
“Refusal to release Democratic response to #NunesMemo - evidence of obstruction of justice by Donald Trump happening in real time,” Blumenthal tweeted.

Trump cited national security concerns in deciding to block the release of the memo, which the committee voted earlier this week to release.
Democrats accused Trump of exhibiting a double standard by blocking the memo after approving the release of the GOP document last week over the objections of the FBI.
“Trump’s refusal to release Democratic response to #NunesMemo makes a mockery of national security and common sense,” Blumenthal tweeted.
“This political ploy reveals the White House’s one-sided transparency. But the public sees through it - the #NunesMemo fell with a deafening thud.”

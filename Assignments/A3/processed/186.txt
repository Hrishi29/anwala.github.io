Trump said he would not allow the release of the Democratic memo, which is aimed at rebutting the GOP-drafted document alleging that FBI and Justice Department officials improperly obtained surveillance warrants on a former Trump campaign adviser.

“Republicans and Democrats on the Intelligence Committee voted UNANIMOUSLY to release this memo,” tweeted Sewell, a member of the committee.
“[Donald Trump] is not interested in transparency, he is interested in protecting himself and derailing the Russia investigation.”

Trump last week approved the release of the GOP memo. The president claimed that memo, which FBI officials strongly recommended against releasing, “totally vindicates” him in the Russia probes.
The House Intelligence Committee voted unanimously to release the Democratic response, pending Trump’s approval. Trump decided Friday not to declassify the document and allow its release, citing national security concerns.

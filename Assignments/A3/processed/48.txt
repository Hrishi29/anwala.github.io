Trump said he would not declassify the memo, blocking it from publication after the House Intelligence Committee voted earlier this week to make the document public.
“Both the Republican and Democratic [Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act] memos should be released,” tweeted Amash, a libertarian-leaning lawmaker who has been critical of Trump.
“I’ve read both memos. Neither one endangers national security. The American people deserve the opportunity to read both memos," he added.

The GOP memo, which accuses FBI and Justice Department officials of surveillance abuse targeting the Trump campaign, was made public last week after Trump decided to declassify it, ignoring a strong FBI recommendation not to publish it.

The House Intelligence Committee voted unanimously on Monday to make the Democrats’ response to the memo public, a move supported by numerous lawmakers.
White House counsel Don McGahn announced Friday that Trump would not approve the release of the memo at this time because it “contains numerous properly classified and especially sensitive passages.”
Trump has already prompted major backlash from Democrats, who are accusing him of having a “double standard” in regards to transparency since he supported the release of the GOP memo.
Trump claimed that the GOP memo released last week “totally vindicates” him in the investigations into whether his campaign colluded with Russia to win the election.

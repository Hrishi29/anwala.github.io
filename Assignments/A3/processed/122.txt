@MoDaD of MegakatCity.com forums and the SWAT Kats Encyclopedia recently visited the Tremblay Bros. Studios to unbox loads of production materials of the animated series SWAT Kats: The Radical Squadron. Some of what heâ€™s uncovered include story boards from various episodes. One of the episodes is The Metallikats, and you can find them here: http://galleries.megakatcity.com/tbs-archives/storyboards-the-metallikats/

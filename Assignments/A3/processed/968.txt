What Is a VPN?
A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a service that allows you to connect to the internet via one of its servers. Those servers are located all over the world. You can read all about it in greater detail in our awesome VPN Beginner’s Guide . In short, doing this gives you extra security, hides your online activities from your Internet Service Provider (ISP) or whoever else may be watching, lets you mask your location, and lets you access all your favorite websites, social media platforms, and streaming services.
A good VPN will cost you, and while they’re reasonably priced overall, expenses will add up over the years. That’s why BestVPN.com has teamed up with ExpressVPN to give lucky winners annual VPN subscriptions – free for one whole year!

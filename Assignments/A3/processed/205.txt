A couple of surprise guests crashed the party Friday morning at the PyeongChang Opening Ceremony...
The Opening Ceremony of the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games was a spectacle to behold, but two notable individuals did not get to witness the pageantry.
A pair of impersonators dressed as United States President Donald Trump and North Korea leader Kim Jong-un were "shown out by security staff" after arriving at PyeongChang Olympic Stadium, according to a Reuters report . 
"We're getting along great," the Kim Jong-un lookalike told Reuters. "We wanted to surprise everyone and bring world peace and then we’re being escorted out by security guards, which I think is really unfair. Doesn’t everyone want peace?
"Is my sister getting the same treatment?"
The pair were photographed by a wire service giving each other a fist bump before getting the boot.

“I’m very sorry I caused such a fuss. I should have never, ever have used the word,” Bluestone told WHDH .
Speaking in front of students, Bluestone said “I wouldn’t mind seeing him (Trump) dead.” He also said he wouldn’t mind seeing Trump “impeached.”
The remarks were recorded in a video uploaded to YouTube by the school on Monday. Bluestone tried to explain why he made the comments.
“What I was saying -- particularly in the context of when I said of natural causes of course, which was my next line -- that this was a call for more protests against this president, who I see as extremely dangerous,” Bluestone said.
The university released a statement following a backlash, saying Bluestone's views do not reflect those of the school:
“While faculty members are free to express controversial opinions, the university cannot provide a public platform for comments that could be construed to condone violence. As a result, we have decided to take down the video of this event.”
Some students said they understood where Bluestone was coming from, but that the remarks were inappropriate.
“I understand where the anger and frustration comes from, but as a professor and a professor representing the university, it’s not something you should be saying,” Gal Nissan said.
Bluestone said he still feels people need to stand up to Trump.
“We need more people to stand up and get angry. We shouldn’t ask for the president’s death, absolutely, but there should be protesting,” Bluestone said.

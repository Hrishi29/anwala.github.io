Shirtless Tonga Flag Bearer Pita Taufatofua Returns For Winter Olympics 2018!
Tonga’s infamous shirtless flag bearer Pita Taufatofua is back!
The 34-year-old Olympian once again lost his shirt to lead the Togan team during the 2018 Winter Olympics Opening Ceremony on Friday (February 9) in Pyeongchang, South Korea.
He showed off his incredible physique while carrying the flag and wearing a traditional Tongan outfit – all in 32 degree weather!
Pita, who competed in taekwondo during the Summer Olympics in 2016 , is now at the Winter Olympics as a cross-country skiier.
In order to get to the games, Pita started a fundraising campaign to finance his trip. He is the only athlete representing Tonga.

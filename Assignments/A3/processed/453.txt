Authorities Bust Ohio Heroin Trafficking Ring Involving Illegal Immigrants
Sen. Lindsey Graham said Thursday that Christopher Steele's dossier on Donald Trump was "political garbage" and nearly completely unverified.
A newly declassified letter from Graham (R-S.C.) and Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa.) refers Steele, a former British spy, for criminal investigation by the Justice Department.

Graham said at least two FBI agents "went rogue" on the Hillary Clinton email investigation, while a "politically-motivated" dossier was later used to obtain the surveillance warrant on Carter Page. 
"It was compiled by a foreign agent who was receiving money from the Democratic Party who went to Russia to get the information. Russia meddled in our elections and they were floating a bunch of garbage to Steele," he said on "America's Newsroom."
However, Graham said Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation is "unconnected to all of this" and he must be allowed to finish his probe.
He has also called for a second special counsel to look into the actions of the FBI and Justice Department, saying there must be accountability for a "process that I think really got off the rails."
"The FBI and Department of Justice's conduct, particularly with the dossier, to me is chilling. Somebody has to watch those who watch us," Graham concluded.

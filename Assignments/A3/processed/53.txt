Only those who have not seen war have any desire to celebrate war. Parades, such as the one the current chief executive demands, are anathema to those who actually served. From the lowest rank to the highest, there is nothing more detested than the idea and reality of a parade. This would seem to be a key indicator of how far out of touch with the military President Trump is at this point. His only quasi-experience with service was at an “academy” that parroted the military. But at the core, it was a school for rich kids. If Donald Trump went to Basic Training, he would have had a traumatic bowel evacuation. And there would be no talk about a parade.
France has an entirely different histoire. The parades in France are apparently the drivers for his directive, but in America we have only done such parades rarely. Victory over the traitors in the Civil War, victory in World War I, World War II—that sort of thing. A parade of the professional military, at the cost of millions, for no reason? Not so much. (Nominally this would be to celebrate the end of WWI, 100 years ago, but that is a farce.)
Here is what a parade consists of “for the troops":
Practice marching for up to 10 hours over several days. See, most of the time soldiers do not parade for show, and doing it requires practice. It is not natural, nor something generally done outside of basic training.
Travel. Travel to where? If you are bringing in 40,000 troops, they have to live, sleep, and eat somewhere. The bases near D.C. do not have the capacity to suddenly house that many temporary duty soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines. So it’s either tents or hotels. Since the optics of tents would be somewhat problematic, I would guess it’s hotels. But whatever, it is just money, right?
On the day of the parade: Wake up at 4 a.m. First formation at 4:30 a.m. Draw weapons (that means go to the arms room and, one at a time, sign for your personal weapon). This takes hours. Chow, but if you are going to be “off-post,” that probably means an MRE, the “Meal Ready to Eat” despised by most. Formation for pre-inspection at 8 a.m., then time for corrections. Inspection formation at 9 a.m.
You realize now that we are five hours in and nothing has actually happened? That is because this is a show. And that is just for an infantry unit.
Tanks?
Are you kidding?
In the past couple of hours, I’ve heard from 14 stars worth of generals. Not a single one supported this. Many told me their stories of how they personally avoided parades as cadets or young officers. And that is just the generals. My inbox was flooded from enlisted and officers of lower ranks. Bottom Line: We all hate parades. We do not want one. What do we want? Why don't you ask us, Mr. President?

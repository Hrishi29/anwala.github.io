A California judge who President Trump criticized during his campaign is set to hear a case regarding the construction of his border wall.
San Diego District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel is reviewing the case Friday, which is being brought on by the state.
The plaintiffs argue the Trump administration is violating the law by not conducting an environmental review for the wall.
However, the federal government says a 1996 immigration law allows them to waive environmental laws in order to build the wall.
During the 2016 fraud case against Trump University, President Trump accused the Mexican-American judge of being biased against him.
Curiel is also a member of the San Diego La Raza Lawyers Association, which reportedly supports pro-illegal immigrant groups.

Much more than body type goes into becoming an elite athlete. But some physical characteristics can provide an edge in one sport or another, said Jay T. Kearney, a performance physiologist who worked with Olympians of all sizes. Take this seven-question quiz to find out which of your traits would be an advantage in Rio.
1. How tall are you?
Very, and donât ask me how the weather is up here.
Average. I can buy clothes off the rack.
Short. Iâm barely allowed on roller coasters.
2. For your height, do you have long legs with a short torso?
Yes. I seem to be mostly legs.
No. My torso is long and my shirts never stay tucked.
3. Do you have long arms for your height?
Yes, all my sleeves are too short.
No, Iâm a little bit T. rex.
4. Do you have big feet or hands?
Big feet. Boats, really.
5. Are your shoulders broad or narrow?
Broad. I can carry the world on them.
Narrow. Iâm more of a lightweight.
Neither
6. Do you have slim hips?
Yes
7. Where are your beefiest muscles?
Upper body. Wanna see my guns?
Lower body. My legs kick butt.
Everywhere. My muscles have muscles.
My muscles aren't beefy. Iâm kind of scrawny.
What muscles? I'm a little flabby. Got a sport for me?

Final results
Congrats! You share physical characteristics with athletes in the following Olympic events. (Sorry, that doesnât guarantee that youâll actually be good at any of them.) Read below for the reasons experts say your traits can give you a leg up in each sport.
archery
1. How tall are you?
Your answer: Very, and donât ask me how the weather is up here.
Your answer: Average. I can buy clothes off the rack.
Your answer: Short. Iâm barely allowed on roller coasters.
basketball, high jumping
The reason is pretty obvious: To reach the rim or bar, taller people need to jump a smaller percentage of their height than shorter people. The average medal-winning male hoops player in 2012 was 6-foot-7; high jumpers averaged 6-foot-4. Women in both sports averaged 6 feet.
boxing
Taller boxers tend to have a longer reach, and heavyweights are often well above 6 feet â although 5-foot-10 Mike Tyson was still pretty good.
hurdling
Hurdlers tend to be the tallest runners, especially in the sprint distances because those hurdles are the highest (42 inches for men, 33 for women). But two of the United States' best ever were exceptions: Allen Johnson (5-foot-10) and Gail Devers (5-foot-3).
rowing
Rowers tend to be tall and muscular because long limbs produce long, powerful strokes. The average height for medalists in 2012 was 6-foot-4 for men and 5-foot-11 for women.
swimming
Because swimming is horizontal, taller people need to travel less distance than shorter people and can begin their turns farther from the wall. A Norwegian study calculated that a 6-foot swimmer would race 1.3 percent faster than a 5-foot swimmer based on height alone.
tennis
A longer body can create more torque, which translates into harder serves and sharper angles.
throwing
Taller athletes can spin a discus or hammer farther from their bodies, allowing it to accelerate faster.
volleyball
The higher your hands are above the net, the higher you can block and the more (and sharper) angles you can use when you serve, hit or spike. Volleyball medalists in 2012 were, on average, just an inch shorter than the basketball players.

cycling
Cyclists come in several sizes, depending on the event. Sprint cyclists and mountain bikers tend to be heavier and shorter; leaner, lankier folks gravitate toward the distance events and can be quite tall. (Team USAâs Taylor Phinney is nearly 6-foot-6.)
soccer
Soccer players are on the tall side of average. (Average was 6 foot for men and 5-foot-6 for women among 2012 medalists.) Very tall players have trouble changing direction quickly; tiny ones are easier to push off the ball and need to jump higher to contest headers.
wrestling
Kearney said that in Greco-Roman wrestling, athletes in lighter classes are shorter, but body type is basically the same because of the physiological demands of the sport. Most are average to short except in the top weight class.
Read More
gymnastics, diving
Compact bodies change direction more quickly and rotate faster in the air. They also tend to be stronger, pound for pound, than longer bodies. Most elite female gymnasts are below 5-foot-4, and the men are not much taller.
marathon
Elite distance runners are often short and always light. For one thing, it takes less energy to haul a smaller body over 26.2 miles. Shorter athletes also climb hills more efficiently, and they shed heat more easily because they have a larger skin surface area relative to body volume.
sprinting
âUsain Bolt will never be a great sprinter because he doesnât fit the prototype,â Kearney said facetiously, because the 6-foot-5 Bolt has sprinted faster than anyone, ever. In theory, he should be too slow out of the blocks to catch up, because short legs overcome inertia better in the vital acceleration phase.
weightlifting
Shorter people have to lift the weight less distance, which requires less work. (More about this in the arms section.) And shorter muscles often produce more power per pound of body weight.

2. For your height, do you have long legs with a short torso?
Your answer: Yes. I seem to be mostly legs.
Your answer: No. My torso is long and my shirts never stay tucked.
basketball, volleyball
People with long legs often jump more efficiently, especially if their thighs are relatively short compared with their lower legs. Itâs mechanics: Lifting a weight with a short lever requires less energy than with a long lever, so people with long legs but short thighs can jump higher with less energy.
cycling
Time-trialists want shorter upper bodies for less wind resistance.
high jumping
The center of gravity starts higher, so it takes a little less oomph to power over the bar. Team USA's Vashti Cunningham, at 6-foot-1 and 123 pounds, has the classic high-jumper body type. But type isn't everything: Her 5-foot-4 teammate, Inika McPherson, can clear a bar that is more than a foot above her own head.
hurdling, running
Long-legged hurdlers can glide over hurdles without having to jump, so thereâs no vertical motion to detract from forward momentum. Long legs, once they get going, can cover ground faster, so they are beneficial in all but the shortest races.
rowing
Long legs create more stroke power; a short torso is more stable in the boat because less mass is above the water. Canoe/kayak athletes tend to be a bit smaller with shorter legs.
Read More
Short legs provide a lower, more stable center of gravity.
gymnastics, diving
Short legs fight inertia less, so they are easier to move quickly. They are also more stable because they lower the bodyâs center of gravity, critical on apparatuses such as the four-inch-wide balance beam.
sprinting
Sprinting is all about quick reaction time, fast acceleration and high leg turnover rate, all of which short legs do better. Major exception: Usain Bolt.
swimming, water polo
Long torsos, like long boat hulls, are more buoyant and slice more easily through the water. Meanwhile, short legs can move much more quickly than long ones to propel the boat â¦ er, body, forward. (Swimmers often have longer lower legs and shorter thighs so they can push more water per stroke.)
throwing
Throwers want a low center of gravity for stability and tend to have longer thighs with shorter lower legs.

3. Do you have long arms for your height?
Your answer: Yes, all my sleeves are too short.
Your answer: No, Iâm a little bit T. rex.
basketball
The higher your reach, the better for dunking, blocking, layups, rebounds, receiving passes, stealing — you get the idea.
boxing
Reach length is so integral to the sport that the measurement is included in pre-fight âtales of the tape.â If upper arms are relatively long, even better: They put power into a punch, while shorter forearms can move and change direction more quickly.
diving
Hereâs the one area in which tiny, compact divers differ from tiny, compact gymnasts. Researchers arenât quite sure why divers tend to have long arms, but they think the extra arm length may help with a clean entry into the water.
rowing
Long arms plus long legs equals long, powerful strokes.
swimming
Arms work like oars, so longer ones push more water. Ideally, forearms would be proportionally longer than upper arms. Freestyle and backstroke swimmers tend to have the longest arms.
throwing
In general, throwers launch the discus and hammer from a spin with their arms extended, so longer arms mean the implement picks up more speed. In javelin and shot put, long arms mean longer contact with the implement, which allows more time to transfer energy.
water polo
Long arms are a huge advantage in intercepting the ball. Longer forearms also mean a better whipping motion when throwing.
volleyball
Long-armed blockers can reach higher above the net. Hitters can hit with more torque and at sharper angles.
Read More
gymnastics
Female gymnasts want short, fast-moving limbs, period. Although longer arms could help male gymnasts on the pommel horse, short arms provide a huge mechanical advantage on strength moves such as the Iron Cross on the rings.
weightlifting
Short levers require less work than long ones for mechanical reasons. First, theyâre lifting the weight a shorter distance, and, second, the weight is closer to the axis of rotation (a.k.a., shoulders and elbows).

4. Do you have big feet or hands?
Your answer: Big feet. Boats, really.
Your answer: Big hands
Your answer: Neither
swimming
Your feet resemble those of the best swimmers in history, and you get bonus points if your feet are also wide. Michael Phelpsâs feet are reportedly size 14, ideal flippers for pushing more water with each stroke.
sprinting
Technically, sprinters may not have bigger feet, but a 2012 Penn State study found that their toe bones were 6.2 percent longer than average. Researchers speculated that that foot shape may allow for a more forceful pushoff.
Read More
basketball, volleyball
Kearney said players tend to have long, slender fingers and hands, which may help with ball control.
swimming, water polo
Big hands can push more water. Also, margins of victory can be so small that an extra-long finger might touch the wall a fraction of a second sooner. Case in point: Michael Phelps won the 100-meter butterfly in 2008 by one-hundredth of a second.
weightlifting
Larger hands can be an advantage, particularly in the lighter weight classes. Kearney said that Tara Nott, the first U.S. woman to win a gold medal in the sport, weighed 105 pounds but had large hands for her size and could grip the bar better than most of her competitors, especially in the snatch event.

Your hands and feet probably arenât an advantage, but hey, they probably arenât a disadvantage either.

5. Are your shoulders broad or narrow?
Your answer: Broad. I can carry the world on them.
Your answer: Narrow. Iâm more of a lightweight.
Your answer: Neither
Wide shoulders mean a longer reach.
rowing
This is a shoulder-centric sport, and rowers tend to have wide, strong shoulders.
swimming, water polo
The most hydrodynamic body is the classic âVâ shape with broad shoulders narrowing to slim hips. Kearney said swimmers also tend to be narrow front-to-back.
throwing
Throwers tend to have wide chests and broad shoulders.
Read More
cycling
Narrow shoulders (and torso, and hips) cause less wind resistance, so distance cyclists tend to be narrow. Technological advances such as aero bars have mitigated that somewhat, allowing a tighter, lower, more aerodynamic position.
gymnastics
Most female gymnasts are narrow in general; men may appear more V-shaped because of their extremely muscular upper bodies.
marathon
Marathoners and other distance runners tend to have narrow torsos in general, for less weight and wind resistance.
Read More
No problem. In many sports, these traits donât particularly matter.

6. Do you have slim hips?
Your answer: Yes
Your answer: No
cycling
Narrow hips (and torso, and shoulders) cause less wind resistance, so distance cyclists tend to be narrow.
diving, gymnastics
Smaller, narrower and more compact is generally always better. Narrow hips run most efficiently, which helps in vault and floor exercise.
hurdling, high jump, marathon, sprinting
Slim hips make for efficient running, so most, if not all, elite track athletes have them. At 5-foot-11, U.S. marathoner Galen Rupp is a bit taller than most but has the classic light, narrow torso and hips floating over long, lean legs.
rowing
Wide hips donât fit comfortably into the narrow boats.
swimming, water polo
The most hydrodynamic body is the classic V shape with broad shoulders narrowing to slim hips.

No problem. In many sports, these traits donât particularly matter.

7. Where are your beefiest muscles?
Your answer: Upper body. Wanna see my guns?
Your answer: Lower body. My legs kick butt.
Your answer: Everywhere. My muscles have muscles.
Your answer: My muscles aren't beefy. Iâm kind of scrawny.
Your answer: What muscles? I'm a little flabby. Got a sport for me?
archery
Archers use arms, back and shoulders. They donât have to be beefy, but they do need strength and incredible control.
boxing
Boxers have particularly muscular arms and shoulders because ... well, they have to punch people.
gymnastics
Male gymnasts have to be very muscular to excel at strength events such as the rings and pommel horse. Female gymnasts tend to be very light in relation to their height, and some are quite willowy. However, not all are stereotypical pixies. U.S. phenom Simone Biles is a powerfully built 4-foot-8, and that muscle combined with a small body makes for wildly acrobatic floor routines and stratospheric vaults.
tennis
Because the modern game emphasizes a power serve, tennis players have much more muscular upper bodies than their predecessors.
Read More
cycling
Short, powerful quadriceps and thighs are a big mechanical advantage in all types of cycling. The longer the distance, the leaner arms and upper body need to be for less weight and wind resistance.
sprinting, hurdling
Some sprinters and hurdlers are heavily muscled; some are more linear. But all these speedy folks have strong leg muscles that contain mostly âfast-twitchâ muscle fibers, which fire quickly and powerfully (but tend to tire quickly).
soccer
All that back-and-forth gives soccer players thickly muscled thighs and calves.
Read More
rowing
Rowers use all major muscle groups and tend to have low body fat. Kearney said the extra power gained from that muscle is greater than the drag on the boat from the additional weight.
swimming, water polo
Weight isnât a big disadvantage in water, so swimmers tend to be solid and powerfully built. Breaststrokers usually have the most powerful trunks.
throwing
The best example may be shot putters, who are very large and heavily muscled â but usually not fat. In addition to strong arms and backs, they have very muscled calves.
weightlifting
Weightlifting is a full-body sport, and lifters tend to be very heavily muscled in calves and quadriceps as well as arms and shoulders. Heavyweights are huge â men often weigh more than 300 pounds and women top 200, Kearney said, because the weight they are lifting is relatively less compared to their bodies.
wrestling
Athletes in sports that restrict weight classes, including judo, taekwondo and weightlifting, tend to have high body-mass index scores because they are very muscular, not fat.
Read More
high jumping
This is an extremely rare body type, Kearney said. High jumpers are among the leanest of all Olympic athletes, have excellent body control and very long, strong but slender legs with mostly fast-twitch muscle fibers.
marathon
Distance runners have muscles, of course, but they are small and lean â classic ectomorph body type. Their muscle fibers are mostly âslow-twitch,â which provide excellent endurance but not much top-end speed. They tend to have high, small calf muscles, making for light lower legs.
volleyball (women)
Kearney said female volleyball players tend to be long and lean, not particularly muscled.
Read More
shooting
Not all Olympic sports require a certain build. Kearney said he remembers one group particularly from his days at the Olympic Training Center: âTrap shooters,â he said. âThey were just plain, good old, overweight sort of beer-bellied country boys, but if you threw something up in the air, they could hit it every time. Whether they were tall or short, big or small, long arms or short arms — it wouldnât be a predisposition to be successful.â So no muscles, no problem — but youâll need good aim.

In what may sound like a repeat from the days of Roy Moore last fall, President Trump has reportedly questioned the credibility of the women accusing Rob Porter of domestic abuse.
Colbie Holderness and Jennifer Willoughby have shared their accounts with the press this week, and Porter said Wednesday he’s stepping down.
Amid all the reports about internal White House turmoil and presidential furor over the handling of this mess, Trump said in front of the cameras today , “We wish him well. He worked very hard. I found out about it recently, and I was surprised by it. But we certainly wish him well.”
People were stunned, if not surprised, by these comments today, but per The Daily Beast , the President has privately questioned the credibility of both women:
In fact, the president has gone as far as to express doubts to aides and friends about the assault allegations, and has asked repeatedly if there are any reasons Porter’s two ex-wives could have to make up such claims, according to three sources with direct knowledge of the conversations.
Trump’s skepticism has been apparent in discussions with confidants and officials, who tell The Daily Beast that, at least in their conversations, he has not expressed sympathy for the ex-wives, Colbie Holderness and Jennifer Willoughby, who have gone on the record to allege physical violence.
This report also confirms previous reporting that Trump is at least a little frustrated with John Kelly and Hope Hicks over how all this was handled.

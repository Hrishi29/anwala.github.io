Kendall Jenner is putting her best foot forward at New York Fashion Week. Today kicks of the first of the Fall 2018 shows, and the model is already trying out looks from the runway. This morning, Jenner was photographed en route to the Adidas Originals presentation wearing the brand’s luxe tracksuit incongruously paired with tights and open-toe Gianvito Rossi heels—just the latest way Jenner is putting her own offbeat spin on her role as a brand ambassador for the athletic gear giant.
Lest you forget, the perennially sporty-chic Jenner tried out socks and stilettos at the Cannes Film Festival in May . While the look sparked a debate as to what is appropriate ankle-wear on what has long since been a more traditional red carpet, all rules go out the window at Fashion Week. That’s certainly true in the case of Adidas Originals, which this season is teaming up with with 23-year-old Dutch design ingenue Daniëlle Cathari . Jenner suited up in the collection's snap-front track jacket and joggers—a bold, deconstructed take on the tracksuit that put the model in the running for best athleisure look at the shows before they even began.

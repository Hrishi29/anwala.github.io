UNF professor and former Korean broadcaster speaks on an unified Korea
https://unfspinnaker.com/65499/news/65499/
<p><font color="Gray">Source: unfspinnaker.com --- Friday, February 16, 2018</font><br />The 2018 <b>Winter</b> <b>Olympics</b> has the world’s attention. Not only do the athletes draw a crowd, but the unprecedented political implications of a unified Korean team have political analysts and citizens globally invested. The world saw a unified Korea introduced at the opening ceremony, and despite an 8-0 loss the next day, unified Korean women’s hockey team won the eyes and hope of the world for peace. UNF communication Professor Siho Nam views the talks leading up to the Pyeongchang <b>Olympics</b> as a catalyst for holistically positive change in the region. Nam previously worked in broadcast in Korea, but he focused on entertainment over anything political. “Because of recent escalating tensions between Kim Jong Un and our president, Trump, I keep getting questions from people if my family is doing fine in South Korea,” Nam said. Despite some hiccups, Nam says his outlook on the renewed conversation between North and South Korean leaders, even just concerning a unified hockey team and the opening ceremony, is a positive one overall. “Anything that can possibly help bring about peace, reconciliation between South and North, I see that as a really positive opportunity,” Nam said. Some political analysts believe North Korea’s rebound of communication is a result of tougher sanctions that the country could be planning to reach out a hand for help or re-establish trade with the rest of the world. Whatever the aim of North Korea, Nam recogniz ...</p>

Lindsey Vonn Fails to Medal in First Winter Olympics Outing in 8 Years
http://people.com/sports/winter-olympics-2018-lindsey-vonn-fails-medal-super-g/
<p><font color="Gray">Source: people.com --- Friday, February 16, 2018</font><br /><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f91e.png" & width="72" & height="72" style="margin: 5pt 10px 0px 0px; float: left;"  border="1" align="left" alt="" />After a long <b>Winter</b> <b>Olympics</b> absence , Lindsey Vonn —the most decorated female skier of all time—failed to take home a medal in her first Olympic event in eight years on Saturday morning (Friday evening stateside). Vonn made her highly anticipated 2018 <b>Winter</b> <b>Olympics</b> debut at the Women’s Super-G, aiming to become the third American athlete with three career Olympic alpine-skiing medals. But her dream was dashed when, first to compete, she set the time at 1:21.49, which was soon bested by several competitors. Commentators said they could see Vonn mouthing “I tried,” after her run, according to Sports Illustrated . Vonn will have another chance to medal in the downhill event later in the Games. The competition came eight long years after Vonn took home gold (downhill) and bronze (Super-G) in the 2010 games in Vancouver, making her the only returning Olympic Super-G medalist among her competitors. Along with Vonn, Switzerland’s Lara Gut, who won bronze in Sochi in the downhill program, was among the athletes going for gold in the speed event, where the winner is decided by just a single run. Team USA’s Mikaela Shiffrin —the 22-year-old skiing phenom who disappointingly came in fourth in the alpine skiing slalom a day earlier after winning gold the previous day in the giant slalom — decided to sit out of the Super-G, which would have been her third continuous day of racing, to rest. However, she tweeted good luck to competitors sho ...</p>

Men's Figure Skating Forecast: Chilly With A Chance Of Pooh Rain
http://news.wsiu.org/post/mens-figure-skating-forecast-chilly-chance-pooh-rain
<p><font color="Gray">Source: news.wsiu.org --- Friday, February 16, 2018</font><br />The weather for the <b>Winter</b> <b>Olympics</b> has not been for the faint of heart. Some of the lowest temperatures on record met athletes for their walk at the opening ceremonies. Events have been delayed and canceled . And Thursday night, a rare kind of precipitation covered the ice at the men's free skating event: Dozens of Winnie the Pooh dolls and plushes. Japanese Olympian Yuzuru Hanyu is a difficult man to follow on the ice. He proved his talent with a gold medal in Sochi 2014. And he claimed first place after an impressive performance in the short program with a score of 111.68 . It also just takes a long time for the young skaters — called "sweepers" — who are tasked with scooping up the horde of plush cubs from the ice. American skater Nathan Chen told The Washington Post he saw a silver lining in the bear-shaped rain cloud. "The only thing I can take away from it is, be prepared for the Pooh bears to rain down," he told the Post. "Good thing about that is that it takes a while for them ...</p>

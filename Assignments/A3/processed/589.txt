(WASHINGTON) — President Donald Trump is explaining his decision not to declassify a Democratic memo, saying the document is “very political” and needs heavy redactions.
The White House told the House Intelligence Committee the president is “unable” to declassify a memo drafted by Democrats about abuse of government surveillance powers in the FBI’s Russia probe.
Trump followed up with a tweet Saturday saying Democrats “knew, because of sources and methods (and more)” that it could not be declassified and released in full. He then claimed that Democrats would in turn blame the White House “for lack of transparency.”
It was not clear what the president meant by “(and more).” The Democratic memo is a response to a Republican memo alleging abuse of those surveillance powers.
The Democrats sent a very political and long response memo which they knew, because of sources and methods (and more), would have to be heavily redacted, whereupon they would blame the White House for lack of transparency. Told them to re-do and send back in proper form!

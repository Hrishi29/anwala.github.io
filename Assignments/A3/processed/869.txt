RIBEIRAO PRETO, Brazil —  Freestyle skier Lais Souza pictured herself parading into the Olympic Stadium with the Brazilian delegation during the 2014 Winter Games opening ceremony. She had successfully switched from gymnastics to the high-flying sport, unexpectedly qualifying for the Sochi Games after just six months of practice.
It all ended two weeks before the last Winter Olympics, when she fell and hit her head on a tree during training in Utah . The former Olympic gymnast was paralyzed from the neck down and struggling to breathe on her own.
Four years later — after 11 months hospitalized in Miami, countless surgeries and constant care from her mother and nurses —  Souza can bend her torso, slightly move her shoulders and regained some sensitivity on her elbows. Her once broken neck is stronger, and she can breathe with enough ease to become a successful motivational speaker. Now she faces an important step in her psychological recovery: watching the Winter Games from Pyeongchang, South Korea.
"I remember watching some of my friends compete in Sochi, but I was still groggy from the medicines at the hospital," the 29-year old Brazilian told the Associated Press at her modest home in Ribeirao Preto, a four-hour drive north of Sao Paulo. "I definitely need to watch this time. I wasn't expecting to qualify for Sochi, I was actually preparing for these games."

Souza competed as a gymnast in the 2004 and 2008 Summer Games in Athens and Beijing, but missed the 2012 Games in London due to a hand injury. As she lamented her absence, Brazil's winter sports confederation saw a potential freestyle skier in the 5-feet-1 athlete, who had put a pair of skis only once while vacationing in Chile. She moved to Canada in July 2013 and qualified for the Games a few months later.

SECOND Trump staffer resigns after being accused of beating his wife: Speechwriter steps down after his former partner says he ran over her foot with a car, put out a cigarette on her hand and threw her into a wall
Speechwriter David Sorensen resigned Friday after the White House learned of the allegations against him 
Sorensen's ex-wife, Jessica Corbett, claimed he was violent and emotionally abusive during their two-and-a-half year marriage 
Corbett said she informed the FBI about the abuse claims last fall as the agency was conducting a background check of Sorensen
Corbett claims Sorenson purposefully ran over her foot with a car, put out a lit cigarette on her hand and pushed her violently against a wall
She also alleges that he grabbed her menacingly during a private boat trip off the coast a Maine, a moment she said she feared for her life
Staff secretary Rob Porter, one of the president's closest aides, resigned Wednesday after the publication of abuse allegations 
Both Sorensen and Porter deny the accusations made against them

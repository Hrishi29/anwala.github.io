But it&#x2019;s still fitting the journalist-activist and historian should weigh in on <strong><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/people/donald-trump#intcid=dt-hot-link">Donald Trump</a></strong>.</p><p data-reactid="222">A cerebral but tough-minded soul tagged &#x201C;Sid Vicious&#x201D; unloads with characteristically acerbic verve in <em><a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/v39/n04/sidney-blumenthal/a-short-history-of-the-trump-family?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=3904&amp;utm_content=usca_nonsubs">A Short History of the Trump Family</a></em> in <em>The London Review of Books</em>. Well, at 10,000 words, it&#x2019;s not that short an opus by the onetime chief Washington correspondent of The New Yorker and former New Republic mainstay.</p><p data-reactid="223">Blumenthal (who I profiled in July for <em><a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/07/is-hillary-clintons-oldest-confidant-also-her-biggest-threat">Vanity Fair</a></em>), opens his latest effort by declaring that &#x201C;the most enduring blight&#x201D; Trump will leave behind will be books straining to make sense of him.</p><p data-reactid="224">&#x201C;It will outlast the pundits holding forth on TV, collecting lecture fees and cranking out bestsellers that retail inside dope gleaned, single-sourced and second-hand, from somewhere near the elevators of Trump Tower. It will not be stemmed even after the memoirs of Trump&#x2019;s associates, unreliable narrators in the spirit of their leader, have been removed from the remainder bins in used bookstores.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid="225">To begin to understand Trump, he says, consider his rich-boy upbringing in Queens and his craving to become Big Heat in Manhattan. It&#x2019;s why Frank Sinatra&#x2019;s <em>New York, New York</em> seems relevant due to that line about &#x201C;little town blues.&#x201D; Trump couldn&#x2019;t ever really make it in Manhattan (he lost 87 percent of the vote there in November), his outsized national reputation aside. He&#x2019;s always been deemed a self-aggrandizing jerk by many, even coming up ethically short by the low standards of New York real estate world.</p><p data-reactid="226">Blumenthal writes, &#x201C;His humiliation at his failure &#x2018;to make it there&#x2019; is at the heart of his vengeful compulsion to wreak humiliation on those he fears will belittle him. The uncontrollable anger that unleashes a regular flood of insults derives from his profound feeling that he has been, is being and will be diminished.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid="227">&#x201C;In a constant state of alert and hurt, he victimizes others because he burns with the feeling that he is the true victim. Every time his outlandish behavior turns him into the butt of a joke, especially at the hands of sources associated with New York, from <em>Spy&#x2019;s</em> jibes to <strong>Alec Baldwin&#x2019;s</strong> impersonation on <em>Saturday Night Live</em>, his rage is stoked.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid="228">It seems hard to dispute Blumenthal that &#x201C;winning the presidency was never a deep desire, more a branding scheme that spun out of control, but Trump has tried to turn his victory into a means to compel New Yorkers finally to genuflect. Washington had never held the slightest allure for him &#x2014; until now when it is leverage over New York.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid="229">Blumenthal, who&#x2019;s about to publish the second volume of a three-volume Abe Lincoln biography (the first was very good), finds ample historical, literary and sociological tracts to explain. One is Thorstein Veblen&#x2019;s 1899 classic, partly about robber barons, <em>Theory of the Leisure Class</em>.</p><p data-reactid="230">There&#x2019;s one that many have employed, namely P.T. Barnum. It doesn&#x2019;t enthuse Blumenthal. &#x201C;The hackneyed comparison is demeaning to Barnum.&#x201D; Barnum was witty, a writer, educator and philanthropist.</p><p data-reactid="231">Another is Herman Melville. He ends with Melville&#x2019;s last full-length book, <em>The Confidence Man: His Masquerade</em>, which followed Melville&#x2019;s poorly received <em>Moby Dick</em> and itself got thumbs down from critics and the market. It was about a con man who boards a Mississippi steamboat and takes on various guises as he exploits passengers.</p><p data-reactid="232">As the great literary critic Perry Miller put it, &#x201C;the only character who escapes the confidence man&#x2019;s swindle, the only one to lack confidence, is the steamboat&#x2019;s barber, who refuses to wield his scissors without first being paid and has hung a large sign in his shop reading: &#x2018;NO TRUST.&#x2019;&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid="233">Blumenthal&#x2019;s point is that, when it comes to Trump, we best follow the barber. It&#x2019;s probably good counsel, even if offered frustratingly as more the outsider than we would have imagined.</p><p data-reactid="234"><strong>Arrest and arraign Conway?</strong></p><p data-reactid="235">Hmmmm. &#x201C;Punish Kellyanne Conway. Do it now. She broke the law on live TV.&#x201D; (<a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2017/02/punish_kellyanne_conway_do_it_now.html">Slate</a>)</p><p data-reactid="236">Don&#x2019;t hold your breath. But amid the rhetorical hyperventilating is this New York Times editorial conclusion:</p><p data-reactid="237">&#x201C;Whatever happens to Ms. Conway, the deeper concern here is over the administration&#x2019;s insistence on treating the White House as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Trump Organization. If Mr. Trump truly cares more about his new job serving the American people than about serving the family empire, he knows what to do: release his tax returns and sell his businesses.&#x201D; (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/opinion/kellyanne-conways-white-house-infomercial.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=opinion-c-col-left-region&amp;region=opinion-c-col-left-region&amp;WT.nav=opinion-c-col-left-region">New York Times</a>)</p><p data-reactid="238"><strong>Extra innings, extra bad idea</strong></p><p data-reactid="239">Major League Baseball is considering experimenting in some minor league games with rules to cut short extra-innings games, such as starting extra innings with a runner on third.</p><p data-reactid="240">The new cottage industry of baseball metrics suggests why this is stupid. As The Ringer notes, &#x201C;Most extra-inning games end relatively quickly anyway, even without the intervention of an automatic runner in scoring position. Last season, two-thirds of games that went to extra innings ended in either the 10th or 11th inning, and only 63 games total lasted until the 12th; the year before, there were just 63, too. That rate extends back further &#x2014; over the past decade, teams have averaged just about four 12-plus-inning games each year.&#x201D; (<a href="https://theringer.com/mlb-extra-innings-rule-change-runner-on-second-base-terrible-idea-329b041c310b#.f9g4hxx02">The Ringer</a>)</p><p data-reactid="241">MLB thinks that 15-inning games are really a mess. But &#x201C;those are even rarer, with just 82 total coming since 2007. That works out to five or six per team over a full decade, and at that rate, each of those games becomes even more memorable, even more of a classic, than the average nine-inning contest.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid="242">Baseball&#x2019;s problems, especially with a younger generation, doesn&#x2019;t really involve extra innings. It&#x2019;s the somnolent pace of nine innings, too many tactical moves by managers, too many commercials between innings and the fact that about 30 percent of outs do not involve a ball even hit into the field of play i.e. lots of strikeouts.</p><p data-reactid="243"><strong>Headline of day (if X-rated)</strong></p><p data-reactid="244">Here&#x2019;s a topic that The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg have seemingly missed in reporting and critiquing the upcoming IPO of Snap: &#x201C;Miranda Kerr and <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/people/evan-spiegel#intcid=dt-hot-link">Evan Spiegel</a> aren&#x2019;t f*cking until marriage because post-virginal chastity is all the rage.&#x201D; (<a href="http://jezebel.com/miranda-kerr-and-evan-spiegel-arent-fucking-until-marri-1792181941">Jezebel</a>)</p><p data-reactid="245"><strong>The point?</strong></p><p data-reactid="246">&#x201C;Kerr and Spiegel are the latest high-profile heterosexual couple to be involved in an openly sexless relationship wherein the woman is the mother of a child from a previous partner (aka a confirmed sex-haver), and the man is described by the woman as &#x2018;traditional.&#x2019;&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid="247"><strong>The Daily Show with <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/people/sean-spicer#intcid=dt-hot-link">Sean Spicer</a></strong></p><p data-reactid="248">Said a regular attendee after the latest yesterday, &#x201C;If the lying &#x2014; call it mendacity &#x2014; continues, real and concerned journalists will simply stop attending, what does that say about our future?&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid="249"><strong>If snowed-in</strong></p><p data-reactid="250">Making video virtue out of atmospheric necessity, here are family friendly videos to download if you&#x2019;re among those snowed in throughout the Northeast.

So let’s just zero in on the money.\n<p>“I’m <em>really</em> rich,” Trump declared while announcing his candidacy in June 2015. To prove it, he released a “Summary of Net Worth” balance sheet, indicating a net worth of $8,737,540,000. A month later he upwardly revised that figure to “in excess of TEN BILLION DOLLARS.” (The caps are his.)</p>\n<p>Since then, a cottage industry of spreadsheet-diving journalists has worked itself into a lather trying to peg his real net worth. But without tax returns to go on, it’s really anybody’s guess. Despite the all-caps figures Trump has dispensed, most estimates from the established financial-media outlets have been lower, FAR LOWER. <em>Forbes</em> put his net worth at $4.5 billion. <em>Fortune</em> postulated $3.7 billion, and later upped it to $3.9 billion. Bloomberg guessed it was “closer to $2.9 billion.”</p>\n<p>In response to these wanton guesstimates, Trump instinctually fired back at the guesstimators. “<em>Forbes</em> is a bankrupt magazine, doesn’t know what they’re talking about.” “<em>Fortune</em> has no idea what my assets are” and “has totally lost its way.” But the real sulfuric acid was reserved for the lowballers over at Bloomberg. As usual, Trump made it personal, even suggesting his “friend,” the former New York City mayor, might be jealous. “Maybe Michael told them to do it,” Trump speculated in the <em>Daily Mail,</em> “because he always wanted to do what I’m doing.” Perhaps wisely, <em>The New Yorker</em>&#8212;even with its legendary phalanx of persnickety fact-checkers&#8212;wouldn’t venture any closer than “just a back-of-the-envelope calculation” of $2.56 billion, “which shouldn’t be taken too seriously.”</p>\n<p>In November, Trump was elected president of the United States in a shocking turn of events. He lost the popular vote by some two million ballots.</p>","socialMedia":[],"photos":{"tout":[{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/27/5748bf85ee949d2f614302a8_hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Alyssa Karas","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg","_embedded":{"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[]},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg","credit":"By John Lamparski/WireImage/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"5748bf85b58adb2f614da194","createdAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","revision":2,"modifiedAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","description":"Getty not 250: 522842094","contributors":{}}]},"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","url":"/people/donald-trump","mainPhotoContributors":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/27/5748bf85ee949d2f614302a8_hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Alyssa Karas","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg","_embedded":{"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[]},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg","credit":"By John Lamparski/WireImage/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"5748bf85b58adb2f614da194","createdAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","revision":2,"modifiedAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","description":"Getty not 250: 522842094","contributors":{}}}],"contributorsAuthor":[],"contributorsPhotographer":[],"publishHistory":{"entityId":"5748bf9ab58adb2f614da195","revision":5,"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","revisionAuthor":"Jarondakie Patrick","searchable":true,"expired":false,"createdAt":"August 1, 2017 5:46 pm","uri":"people/donald-trump"},"related":[{}]},"relatedItems":{"items":[{"revisionAuthor":"Rachel Freeman","hed":"Stephen Colbert Won’t Let Trump Get Away with That Ratings Lie","body":"<div class=\"embed block video row\"><div class=\"wrapper\"><iframe height=\"360\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7JmgrNkvNqY\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allowtransparency=\"true\"> </iframe></div></div><p>Once again, <strong>Donald Trump</strong> is boasting about records he did not break.

The most recent: a <em>New York</em> report <a href=\"https://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/02/white-house-official-called-trump-a-deplorable.html\">published Monday</a> detailing a series of messages sent by White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary <strong>Raj Shah</strong> while he was still working for the Republican National Committee.</p>\n<p>In the messages, Shah reportedly called Trump a “deplorable” and celebrated the release of the <em>Access Hollywood</em> tape as “some justice.” The White House defended Shah as a “talented operative and skilled communicator” who had already disclosed the messages, and Shah himself appeared on Fox Business to say that Trump had eventually “won [him] over.” But by then, Shah had joined the ranks of a list that’s likely to grow over time&#8212;as one White House adviser told <em>New York</em>’s <strong>Olivia Nuzzi,</strong> “You hear them say things like, <em>I’m serving the country</em>” . . . “That’s code for, <em>I hate the fucker.</em>”</p>\n<p><strong>Scott Pruitt</strong></p>\n<p>Back in February 2016, Pruitt, who is currently under investigation for potential <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/12/12/epa-watchdog-plans-to-investigate-scott-pruitts-25000-secure-phone-booth/\">abuse of taxpayer dollars</a>, was (like Shah) a <strong>Jeb Bush</strong> supporter. On February 4, the Environmental Protection Agency head <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2018/01/30/scott-pruitt-once-said-trump-would-be-more-abusive-to-the-constitution-than-barack-obama-and-thats-saying-a-lot/?utm_term=.7c5cb8c9215f\">reportedly</a> told a local Oklahoma radio station that Trump “would be more abusive to the Constitution than Barack Obama&#8212;and that’s saying a lot.” In a subsequent interview on February 11, Pruitt <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/05/politics/kfile-scott-pruitt-trump-rule-of-law/index.html\">added</a> that Trump would be “an empty vessel when it comes to things like the Constitution and rule of law,” and that he was “very concerned that perhaps if [Trump is] in the White House, that there may be a very blunt instrument as the voice of the Constitution.” (In a statement rebutting the claims, Pruitt, like Shah, said his opinions had changed after meeting Trump, whom he now called “the most consequential leader of our time.”)</p>\n<p><strong>Rex Tillerson</strong></p>\n<p>The secretary of State allegedly called Trump a “<a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/rex-tillerson-still-wont-deny-he-called-trump-moron-685477\">moron</a>,” and spent months thereafter dismissing <a href=\"https://www.aol.com/article/news/2017/12/19/tillerson-abruptly-leaves-podium-after-dismissing-resignation-rumors-as-ridiculous-in-awkward-exchange-with-reporter/23311653/\">rumors</a> that he was stepping down, but neither confirmed nor denied the rumor. “I’m not going to deal with petty stuff like that,” he <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/tillerson-s-fury-trump-required-intervention-pence-n806451\">told reporters</a> at the time.</p>\n<p><strong>H.R.

Crap Out of You","body":"<p>If you only paid attention to the words that tumbled out of his mouth, you might believe that <strong>Donald Trump</strong> was a successful real-estate developer, just like you might also think he’s a “<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/01/trump-very-stable-genius-tweets\">stable genius</a>” with a “<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/trump-clinton-no-stamina-look-228740\">winning temperament</a>” who <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/4546859/donald-trump-boasts-he-could-have-had-sex-with-princess-diana-and-joked-about-forcing-her-to-have-hiv-test-in-radio-interview-just-months-after-she-died/\">had a shot with Princess Diana</a>. In reality, none of these things are true. In the wake of multiple bankruptcies, the Trump Organization shifted from developing properties on its own to licensing its founder’s name to others for multi-million-dollar fees, in what <em>Forbes</em> once <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/steveolenski/2015/11/24/donald-trumps-real-secret-to-riches-create-a-brand-and-license-it/#5725f28d3622\">called</a> a “low-effort, low-risk, high-reward cash flow proposition.” With no capital on the line, Trump was free to sit back <a href=\"https://www.eater.com/2016/5/5/11602942/donald-trump-taco-bowl-cinco-de-mayo\">with a taco bowl</a>, take a cut of the profit, and deal with none of the consequences if and when a project <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-donald-trump-can-make-money-even-when-trump-branded-properties-fail/2015/07/23/1ff64854-2ef1-11e5-8353-1215475949f4_story.html\">ran into trouble</a>. And now, he wants to apply the same model to a $1.5 trillion infrastructure deal.</p>\n<p>In his State of the Union speech last night, Trump <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/30/politics/2018-state-of-the-union-transcript/index.html\">said</a> that he was “calling on Congress to produce a bill that generates at least $1.5 trillion for the new infrastructure investment we need,” noting that “every federal dollar should be leveraged by partnering with State and local governments and, where appropriate, tapping into private sector investment&#8212;to permanently fix the infrastructure deficit.” Previously, the administration had said it would put in $200 billion and would expect the private sector, along with state and local governments, to pony up $800 billion for a nice, round $1 trillion plan. Now they’re apparently going to have to dig a little deeper, for no other apparent reason than because Trump thinks $1.5 trillion sounds better. That might seem like a great deal for the federal government, except for the fact that by allocating a mere $200 billion&#8212;when you take <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-budget/three-key-questions-about-the-trump-infrastructure-plan\">the White House’s proposed infrastructure cuts</a> into account, it comes out as even less&#8212;they’ll have to prioritize corporate profits over the actual needs of the public.</p>\n<p>In order to get a return on their investment, which is&#8212;understandably!&#8212;the only reason private companies will want to get involved here, the government will naturally offer them lucrative tax breaks. But, as <em>The Washington Post</em> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2018/01/30/trump-is-going-to-propose-an-infrastructure-plan-tonight-its-a-scam/?utm_term=.811842cf3016\">points out</a>, unlike typical public-private partnerships wherein the government is the ultimate owner of the road or bridge constructed by a private company, it’ll all be under private ownership.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“PriveCo Equity Partners [get] a gigantic tax incentive to build the bridge, which the company now owns&#8212;and which will charge tolls on [it] in perpetuity. Taxpayers could shell out nearly as much in tax incentives to the private company as we would have spent to just build the bridge, and then on top of that you’ll have to pay tolls to cross it&#8212;<em>forever.</em> As long as the bridge stands, people are paying extra so PriveCo Equity Partners can make a profit.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And because Trump &amp; Co. will pay for no more than 20 percent of any given project, states and localities that don’t have the extra funds will most likely be shit out of luck. As the <em>Post</em>’s <strong>Paul Waldman</strong> notes, “the focus on private investment . . . will naturally privilege projects that can generate a profit for private companies, which probably won’t be the most sorely needed upgrades.” According to a <a href=\"https://democracyforward.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Infrastructure-Report.pdf\">new report</a> released this week by the left-leaning Democracy Forward, under the rubric for judging grant applicants, a whopping 70 percent of a project’s score “would be based on the availability of non-federal revenue,” whereas the “economic and social returns” it could generate make up 5 percent. Sorry, Flint, Michigan! You don’t really need new pipes, right?</p>\n<p>Of course, this was all by design. Less scary than the fact that Trump’s friends might <a href=\"https://www.bondbuyer.com/news/who-benefits-from-trumps-infrastructure-plan\">financially benefit from the plan</a> is the promise (threat?) he made last night that “any bill must . . . streamline the permitting and approval process,” by which he means <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/green/news/2018/01/28/445496/trumps-infrastructure-scam-will-gut-environmental-protections-benefit-corporate-polluters/\">gut environmental protections and put public health</a> at risk. On the bright side, no one actually believes that President Hard Hat’s plan will come to fruition, at least not in its current form. “Not to be morbid, but an infrastructure catastrophe could move the needle . . . and spur congressional action,” political strategist <strong>Chris Krueger</strong> <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-infrastructure-plan-dead-on-arrival-2018-1\">told</a> Business Insider. “Barring some kind of morbid catalyst, [the plan’s passage] seems extremely unlikely.”</p>\n<p><em><strong>If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, <a href=\"http://tinyletter.com/besslevin\">click here</a> to subscribe.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Judge rules Mick Mulvaney will have to work hard to destroy the C.F.P.B.</strong></p>\n<p>Since the day the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was formed, Republicans have been raving about how it’s an unconstitutional menace that must be stopped. Unfortunately for people like Representative <strong>Jeb Hensarling,</strong> who thinks the bureau is a “dictator,” a court has more or less declared that this argument <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/31/consumer-protection-bureau-structure-upheld-in-blow-to-trumps-deregulation-efforts.html\">is bullshit</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is constitutional, an appeals court ruled Wednesday in a blow to President Donald Trump&#39;s efforts to ease regulations on the financial system.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit made the ruling in a battle over whether the president could remove the director at will. The court in October had upheld a challenge to the structure but agreed to rehear the case.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Republicans had challenged the C.F.P.B. structure on grounds that the director&#39;s position was unaccountable to the executive branch.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On the bright side, now that the C.F.P.B.’s acting director is a guy who thinks the place shouldn’t exist, he can simply chip away at it from the inside. It’ll require a little more effort and creativity, but if anybody is up to the challenge, it’s <strong>Mick</strong> “<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/11/mick-mulvaney-cfpb\">The C.F.P.B. is a sick, sad joke</a>” <strong>Mulvaney.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>You get a Twinkie! And <em>you</em> get a Twinkie!</strong></p>\n<p>Hostess Brands is using its tax bill savings to reward employees with <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-31/twinkie-maker-s-response-to-the-trump-tax-overhaul-free-snacks\">snacks</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The company, which makes Twinkies, Ding Dongs and Ho Hos, is providing its employees one-time payments of $1,250&#8212;with $750 in cash and $500 in the form of a 401(k) contribution. In taking the step, Hostess cited last month’s tax legislation, which slashed the rate for U.S. corporations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It’s also offering a year’s worth of free food to workers&#8212;though they won’t be able to eat all the Ding Dongs they like. A representative from each of Hostess’s bakeries will choose a product each week, and the employees will be able to take home a multipack of that item. The company also makes Hostess CupCakes, Fruit Pies, and Donettes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Surprise: close friend of alleged serial abuser/president has no problem with second alleged serial abuser/casino mogul</strong></p>\n<p>“I can tell you as being a personal friend, he is a first-class human gentleman and I’ve never seen a taint of any of this,” investor <strong>Tom Barrack</strong> <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-31/barrack-defends-steve-wynn-as-first-class-human-in-tsunami\">told</a> Bloomberg of casino owner <strong>Steve Wynn,</strong> who was accused making manicurists and masseuses at the Wynn’s on-site spa have sex with him.

Trump Should Pull a Prince William and Go Bald","body":"<p>The time has come for <strong>Donald Trump</strong> to lean into baldness. He should take his razor settings all the way to one and <em>zip-zip</em> . He should call <strong>John Kelly</strong> or whomever into the Oval, hand him some sheers, hold up a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/01/prince-william-shaved-head\">photo of <strong>Prince William,</strong></a> and say, “Make my head look like this head, please.” Whatever method the president chooses, it all should go, from the bits that threaten to slink down the back of his neck to the generous swoop of the forelock.</p>\n<p>A viral 20-second video prompted the realization. Filmed as he departed from Joint Base Andrews to Florida on Friday, the video shows the wind creeping up the leader of the free world’s back as he ascends the stairs to Air Force One, exposing the wan horror of the back of his head. HuffPost’s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ashleyfeinberg/status/961067979692789760\"><strong>Ashley Feinberg</strong></a> first spotted the clip on cable news:</p>\n<div class=\"embed block video row\"><div class=\"wrapper\"><iframe height=\"315\" width=\"560\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vHwOMWGAg_o\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allowtransparency=\"true\"> </iframe></div></div><p>It looks horrifying, the back of his head. I’d argue, though, that it’s only scary because there’s so much mystery and antagonism spun up in there. <em>What’s that hair made of?,</em> we’ve wondered despite ourselves for years. Why does it flap like that, come <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/photos/2017/02/donald-trump-versus-the-wind\">wind</a> or <a href=\"http://gawker.com/is-donald-trump-s-hair-a-60-000-weave-a-gawker-invest-1777581357\">eagle</a>? What secrets is he hiding? Did we expect to find Voldemort has been there the whole time? Is that actually skin? Do we know?</p>\n<p>Trump’s hair has always been at best bad, and at worse, a metaphor for an ugly, expensive veneer that succeeds only in exposing his insecurity. It’s a flimsy, transparent shield. This video suggests he should dispense with the charade, free his head from the offending strands, and walk into the light exposed. Imagine what letting go of it all would do. Imagine how transformative such vulnerability could be. Imagine the strength that owning that vulnerability could offer the president, and by extension, these United States. Imagine the <strong>Jason Statham</strong>-ification of the man.</p>","channel":"Style","subChannel":"Celebrity","tags":["donald trump","prince william","vanities"],"ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"dek":"It would be the ultimate sign of strength.","seoTitle":"Video Evidence That Donald Trump Should Pull a Prince William and Go Bald","seoDescription":"It would be the ultimate sign of strength.","socialTitle":"Video Evidence That Donald Trump Should Pull a Prince William and Go Bald","socialDescription":"It would be the ultimate sign of strength.","issueDate":"","rubric":"A Red Hairing","promoHed":"Video Evidence That Donald Trump Should Pull a Prince William and Go Bald","promoDek":"It would be the ultimate sign of strength.","id":"5a7b1e901721ea184434b71a","revision":18,"createdAt":"February 7, 2018 10:43 am","modifiedAt":"February 7, 2018 3:42 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"February 7, 2018 3:42 pm","_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Jordan Amchin","filename":"Trump-Prince-William-Hair.jpg","aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1440,"height":960,"format":"JPEG","duration":null,"url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2018/02/07/5a7b576f1721ea184434b72e_Trump-Prince-William-Hair.jpg"},"3:2":{"override":false,"height":960,"width":1440,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":960,"width":1440,"x":0,"y":0}},"duration":null},"5:3":{"override":false,"height":864,"width":1440,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":864,"width":1440,"x":0,"y":0}},"duration":null},"2:3":{"override":false,"height":960,"width":640,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":960,"width":640,"x":400,"y":0}},"duration":null},"9:16":{"override":false,"height":960,"width":540,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":960,"width":540,"x":450,"y":0}},"duration":null},"7:3":{"override":false,"height":615,"width":1435,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":615,"width":1435,"x":2.5,"y":0}},"duration":null},"16:9":{"override":false,"height":810,"width":1440,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":810,"width":1440,"x":0,"y":0}},"duration":null},"4:3":{"override":false,"height":960,"width":1280,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":960,"width":1280,"x":80,"y":0}},"duration":null},"1:1":{"override":false,"height":960,"width":960,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":960,"width":960,"x":240,"y":0}},"duration":null}},"title":"Trump-Prince-William-Hair.jpg","cropMode":"TOP","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":true,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":false},"restrictCropping":false,"id":"5a7b576f1721ea184434b72f","revision":1,"createdAt":"February 7, 2018 2:45 pm","modifiedAt":"February 7, 2018 2:46 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"February 7, 2018 2:46 pm","credit":"Left, by Chris Kleponis/Pool/Getty Images;

It’s an idea that seems almost quaint on this side of the Instagram filter, but it opened with a discussion of a discounted 15-carat Graff wedding ring, which Trump had claimed he got half-off in exchange for publicity. “Only a fool would say, ‘No thank you, I want to pay a million dollars more for a diamond,’” Trump told the paper.</p>\n<p>On Thursday, however, 13 years into the Trump marriage, Graff Diamonds has denied that this deal was ever struck. <strong>Laurence Graff,</strong> the jeweler’s chairman, told <em><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2018/02/08/trump-lied-about-what-he-paid-for-melanias-engagement-ring/#534ff820371a\">Forbes</a></em> that Trump’s claim was not true. Graff said the company did Trump “no [favors],” though the current president was “a pleasure to do business with.” Company’s C.F.O. <strong>Nicholas Paine</strong> reiterated, “We don’t sell items for publicity value.” A third source with knowledge of the transaction told <em>Forbes,</em> “He paid for [the ring] in full, and he paid immediately.” The great dealmaker has struck again.</p>\n<p>Graff did place its product on <em>The Apprentice</em> in November 2004. A winning team of second season contestants <a href=\"http://ew.com/article/2004/11/12/apprentice-most-unfair-episode-ever/\">received $50,000</a> to spend at the New York location as a reward at the end of an episode (the top end of sponsorship for the show could cost <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=HZgUCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;dq=graff%20jewelry%20second%20season%20apprentice&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8sk979kK04&amp;sig=ha0_qmo0DQHJCndWAycHEtNV6sQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiguNPg75bZAhUNON8KHeyFCY0Q6AEITTAK#v=onepage&amp;q=product%20placement%20and%20the%20apprentice&amp;f=false\">up to $25 million</a> so knocking a bit off the retail price of a diamond actually sounds like a steal).</p>\n<p>Neither Graff nor <em>Forbes</em> specifies why the jeweler is commenting on the purchase 15 years later. In 2004, when the news of the exchange originally grabbed headlines, Graff <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3613530/The-Donald-the-mystery.html\">declined</a> to comment, and as recently as a month ago, a company rep told <em><a href=\"http://www.townandcountrymag.com/style/jewelry-and-watches/a14783066/celebrity-free-jewelry/\">Town &amp; Country</a></em> that “it is not our practice to comment on client relationships.” (After the <em>Forbes</em> report, <em>Town &amp; Country</em> repackaged the story around the new information, and removed the “no comment” from Graff. The quote still appears in a cached version of the article.) Though the company now denies a special deal, they still won’t specify how much Trump paid for the diamond in the end.</p>\n<p>The story did change a couple times over the years. In 2004, while Trump was chastising his son <strong>Don Jr.,</strong> who had accepted an offer for a free diamond ring in exchange for a public proposal at a mall in New Jersey, on <em><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0411/24/lkl.01.html\">Larry King</a>,</em> Trump admitted he “negotiated” a “great price” for Melania’s ring. “Hey, I bought a ring,” he said. “I got it from Graff. You negotiated hard. I said you’re going to get a lot of publicity and I want a great price blah, blah, blah. But I don’t do a big stunt over it.” (Why he decided to knock his kid on national television for largely doing what he did on a daily basis is another Trumpian mystery, but the Juniors got theirs later. See this profile in the <em><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/21/arts/21iht-trump.3611735.html\">Times</a></em> where Don’s wife, <strong>Vanessa Trump,</strong> said she assumed Donald Trump was special needs the first time she met him in 2003).</p>\n<p>Less than a month later, <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2004/12/08/free-ring-circus-zillionaire-trump-deals-to-get-wedding-band-gratis/\">Trump sources gave way to headlines claiming</a> that the “great price” was free in exchange for the publicity. But by 2005, Trump was back to saying that he paid for it, telling the <em>Times</em> that he got half off the $1.5 million price tag. The weight of the ring kept changing, too. The <em>Post</em> lists it at 13 carats, and <em>The New York Times</em> at 15 carats. <em>Forbes</em> safely lists it at “more than 10 carats.”</p>","channel":"Style","subChannel":"Celebrity","tags":["melania trump","laurence graff","graff diamonds","donald

Colbert,</strong> <strong>Trevor Noah,</strong> and <strong>Jordan Klepper</strong> will all broadcast live after the event, while <strong>Jimmy Kimmel</strong> will interview <strong>Stormy Daniels,</strong> the porn star whom the president <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-lawyer-arranged-130-000-payment-for-adult-film-stars-silence-1515787678\">reportedly paid</a> to keep silent about a sexual encounter between them. Hosts are so excited for the buffet before them that they got started on their jokes Monday night, reaching a clear consensus: the state of our union is . . . tenuous.</p>\n<p>“Tomorrow night, of course, is President Trump’s first State of the Union address,” Colbert quipped during his opening monologue on <em>Late Show.</em> “He’s not scheduled to appear in front of Congress again until the impeachment hearings.”</p>\n<p>“The administration wants to showcase what the country is like, now that the Republicans are in charge of everything,” Colbert added, “and they may have done just that, because they sent out these <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/29/politics/state-of-the-uniom-ticket-typo/index.html\">actual tickets to the State of the “Uniom”</a> . . . They’re gonna reprint the tickets, and they’re gonna recall the old ones&#8212;which could be tough, because I’ve seen members of the Trump administration testify, and they can’t recall <em>anything.</em>”</p>\n<p>Perhaps, Colbert suggested, the misspelling was intentional. “Donald Trump said he would shake things up; he would change things,” the comedian noted. “Maybe tomorrow will be the first State of the Uniom. ‘My fellob Anerimicans: with Dolin Trunk as your predisent, every mang, woban, and chilm will know the state of our uniom is strog. So strog.’”</p>\n<div class=\"embed block video row\"><div class=\"wrapper\"><iframe height=\"360\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dqh4xQMbcvg\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allowtransparency=\"true\"> </iframe></div></div><p>Meanwhile, <strong>Seth Meyers</strong> joked, “President Trump will deliver his first State of the Union address tomorrow. So if you want to know how the country is doing, the State of the Union is being delivered by Donald Trump.”</p>\n<p>During his <em>Late Night</em> monologue, Meyers also addressed <strong>Sarah Huckabee Sanders’s</strong> assertion that the address will be “must-watch TV,” saying, “Incidentally, ‘must-watch TV’ is also the first thought that goes through Trump’s head when he wakes up in the morning.”</p>\n<div class=\"embed block video row\"><div class=\"wrapper\"><iframe height=\"360\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/krXk_DSfzcE\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allowtransparency=\"true\"> </iframe></div></div><p>And then there was Kimmel, who noted that the State of the Union “is the one day of the year presidents are supposed to brag about their accomplishments&#8212;so he’s been training for this, really, for his whole life.”</p>\n<p>“They released the theme today,” Kimmel continued. “It’s ‘safe, strong, proud,’ based on the three words he never heard from his father.”</p>\n<p>Kimmel also couldn’t help but address the ticket typo: “We’re already off to a good start,” he said. “If I’m not mistaken, the Uniom was the side that won the Civil Warm.

The reviews, as one might expect, were not tremendous.</p>\n<p>Said one stylist, “Someone did <em>not</em> glue that down tight enough!” Another murmured, through laughter, “That’s a bad weave.” Two compared the back of Trump’s head to animal derrières: one offered that it “looks like the backside of a dog,” while the other went a bit more exotic, saying, “That looks like ostrich butt. That looks like the behind of an ostrich.” Other comments included: “Um, it’s bad”; “It’s awful”; “It’s that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWr30uoSCrw\">monster</a> from <em>The Goonies.</em>” Their recommendations?

He riffed on the reveal for a solid minute:</p>\n<p>“Wow, dude,” Meyers said. “Well, I guess there’s one draft you <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/10/mccain-slams-the-disgraceful-reason-trump-skipped-vietnam\">couldn’t dodge</a>. Hey, Trump, where are you going? Bald? And you thought CNN was giving you bad coverage. It’s like a mullet, except nobody showed up to the party in the back. This explains why he’s so intent on keeping the coal industry alive; look what wind does to him! I’ve seen more hair on a sonogram.

So Determined to Kill PBS?","body":"<p>It’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUB96vgwotg\">a less than wonderful kind of day</a> for PBS, as <strong>President Trump</strong> has once again embarked on a quest to gut public-media funding.</p>\n<p>First, a caveat: a budget proposal is more of a wish list than a solid resolution. Last year, Trump famously <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/01/donald-trump-arts-and-humanities-budget-cuts\">proposed</a> eliminating the National Endowment for the Arts and National Endowment for the Humanities and privatizing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting&#8212;which, in part, funds PBS. But those ideas never actually materialized. In this year’s budget proposal, though, Trump seems to be taking a second stab at killing Big Bird’s erstwhile home by once more suggesting that the government <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2018/02/trump-budget-proposal-is-a-cry-from-the-conservative-id/\">yank</a> funding for the N.E.A. and N.E.H., as well as funding for PBS.</p>\n<p>This news is likely not a surprise to anyone at PBS itself, which has weathered its share of fiscal attacks from the right recently&#8212;even though its programming serves a nonpartisan function. PBS president and C.E.O. <strong>Paula Kerger</strong>  issued a statement Monday in response to the budget proposal, writing, “Public broadcasting has earned bipartisan Congressional support over the years thanks to the value we provide to taxpayers. PBS, our 350 member stations and our legions of local supporters will continue to remind leaders in Washington of the significant benefits the public receives in return for federal funding, a modest investment of about $1.35 per citizen per year, which include school readiness for kids 2-8, support for teachers and homeschoolers, public safety communications and lifelong learning. PBS is focused on providing high-quality content and universal public service to the American people, which is why we enjoy strong support in every region of the country, in both rural and urban areas, and across the political spectrum.”</p>\n<p><strong>Patricia Harrison,</strong> president and C.E.O. for Corporation for Public Broadcasting, echoed Kerger’s sentiments in <a href=\"https://www.cpb.org/pressroom/statement-cpb-president%E2%80%99s-fy-2019-budget-proposal-eliminating-funding-public-media\">her own statement</a>, writing, “Americans place great value on having universal access to public media’s educational and informational programming and services, provided commercial free and free of charge. Since there is no viable substitute for federal funding that would ensure this valued service continues, the elimination of federal funding to C.P.B. would at first devastate, and then ultimately destroy public media’s ability to provide early childhood content, life-saving emergency alerts, and public affairs programs.”</p>\n<p>The G.O.P.’s battle against Big Bird dates back decades; Republicans have been trying, unsuccessfully, to fully defund public-media funding since the <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2017/03/16/media/public-media-pbs-npr-budget-cuts/index.html\">1970s</a>. But younger Americans likely best remember when <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/theoval/2012/10/06/obama-romney-2012-election-big-bird-debate/1616815/\">the yellow fowl</a> became a central talking point during the 2012 election, thanks to a debate in which <strong>Mitt Romney</strong> vowed to cut funding to public broadcasting&#8212;despite insisting, “I like Big Bird!”</p>\n<p>Before Romney, there was Ronald Reagan, who once mulled eliminating the N.E.A. And before him, there was Richard Nixon, whose threat to cut C.P.B. funding prompted a stirring (and effective) <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKy7ljRr0AA\">defense</a> from PBS personality Fred Rogers&#8212;known best to most as Mister Rogers&#8212;before the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee, touting the great things that PBS and its contemporaries achieve despite their already meager budgets.</p>\n<p>Conservatives have long argued that the free market should fund PBS and the like, not taxpayers. But it’s also worth noting that funding for these entities makes up a measly portion of the national budget&#8212;.016 percent, as of last year. Cutting them, then, offers very little practical benefit.</p>\n<p>So, why are Trump and the G.O.P. so bent on doing it, anyway? Most likely, it’s because PBS and its ilk are perfect targets for the right. They combine two of the G.O.P.’s favorite punching bags: the media and government spending. Past research has also <a href=\"http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2011/images/03/31/rel4m.pdf\">shown</a> that the American public <em>believes</em> public media hogs a much larger share of the federal budget than it actually receives. For Republicans, antagonizing these entities is a can’t-lose situation: public media is a highly visible, tangible enemy. And even if cuts don’t actually materialize, calling for them is a way to appear like fiscally responsible governors who have been stopped in their tracks by biased liberal media and politicians, bent on spending every last penny on kiddie shows and <em>Masterpiece Theatre.</em></p>\n<p>The good news? These cuts are, once again, very unlikely to materialize once the proposed budget jumps through all the requisite legislative hoops. Republicans have been playing this losing game for several decades; continuing the game at this point just means expelling more rhetorical hot air. If only there were <a href=\"http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/arthurs-fist\">an appropriate meme</a> to express this repeated frustration.</p>","channel":"Hollywood","subChannel":"Television","tags":["donald trump","pbs"],"ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"dek":"On Monday, the president unveiled a 2019 budget that, as some predicted, eliminates funding for public media.","seoTitle":"Why Are Trump and the G.O.P.

This year’s theme, “Creating a Shared Future in a Fractured World,” drew lofty speeches from various leaders who made the case for a “renewed commitment to international collaboration as a way of solving critical global challenges.” German Chancellor <strong>Angela Merkel</strong> <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/01/angela-merkel-at-davos-we-need-global-cooperation-not-walls/\">cautioned</a> against unilateralism: “Ever since the Roman Empire, ever since the Chinese Wall, we know that shutting ourselves off doesn&#39;t help to protect your borders,” she said. “You also need good cooperation with your neighbors, you need good agreements, valid agreements that are respected.” Indian Prime Minister <strong>Narendra Modi</strong> <a href=\"https://qz.com/1186666/davos-2018-indias-modi-says-climate-change-protectionism-and-terrorism-are-the-worlds-greatest-threats/\">warned</a> that protectionism, terrorism, and climate change are the biggest threats facing the globe, and urged leaders to “back their words with their resources to help developing countries to adopt appropriate technology.” French President <strong>Emmanuel Macron</strong> <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/angela-merkel-emmanuel-macron-davos-speeches/\">called on</a> fellow heads of state to agree to concrete actions on climate change, and Canadian Prime Minister <strong>Justin Trudeau</strong> <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/01/pm-keynote-remarks-for-world-economic-forum-2018/\">blasted</a> gender inequality, saying that companies must not only pay women as much as men, but must address the “whole host of barriers facing women in the workplace.”</p>\n<p>Then, it was the president of the United States’ turn. But rather than take inspiration from the sweeping proclamations of his fellow world leaders, <strong>Donald Trump</strong> did his best impression of a middle manager pitching regional investors on a fast-food franchise. Declaring that there has “never been a better time” to invest in America, Trump, as expected, touted his yuge corporate tax cut, gains in the stock market, and a surge in economic growth&#8212;a phenomenon that is, in fact, being felt <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4b9e6190-f55e-11e7-88f7-5465a6ce1a00\">worldwide</a>. He emphasized his administration’s focus on gutting regulations, referencing his two-for-one deal wherein for every new regulation proposed two must be scrapped. One of his lines, verbatim, was, “We have tremendous amounts of money.”</p>\n<p>Somewhat counterintuitively, he was forced to frame the U.S. prior to January 20, 2017, as some kind of backwater economic basket case, if only to serve the narrative that he, Trump, had swooped to its rescue: “The world is witnessing the resurgence of a strong and prosperous America,” he reassured the crowd. He also claimed that “America First” policies deliver a net positive, explaining that when he, for instance, pulls out of trade agreements and slaps tariffs on imports, it’s because he’s rooting out “unfair economic practices” that “undermines us all.”</p>\n<p>Because the bar had been set so low and Trump didn’t, like drop trou or threaten nuclear war, reviews have been largely positive. “I was glad to hear him say it is ‘America First’ but not America alone,” Cardinal <strong>Peter Turkson,</strong> who heads up the pope’s initiatives on migration and the environment, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-to-promote-u-s-as-open-for-business-in-davos-speech-1516962420\">told</a> <em>The Wall Street Journal.</em> “Certainly he was very successful in presenting his successes,” <strong>Stephan Gemkow,</strong> chairman of investment firm Haniel, <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2018/01/26/news/trump-davos-reaction-wef/index.html\">acknowledged</a>. Others were less enthused at his “America First” report card. “It was a speech about what he has done,” said Danish finance minister <strong>Kristian Jensen.</strong> “I would have liked to hear more about how he will renew international cooperation. I miss America on the international scene.” U.K. designer <strong>Pippa Small</strong> took issue with the fact that “there were so many issues omitted, climate change obviously being a huge one. . . . It was just all about money,” adding, “it’s almost making me cry.” <strong>Renat Heuberger,</strong> chief executive of Swiss environmental group South Pole, was blunter, telling the <em>Journal,</em> “It’s a disaster. What he’s calling for is global egoism. It’s the survival of the fittest . . . He believes that by destroying the environment, business will thrive.

Trump’s Face?","body":"<p><strong>Donald Trump</strong> <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-29/on-flight-to-davos-trump-erupted-over-doj-role-in-russia-probe\">reportedly</a> “erupted in anger” aboard Air Force One last week when he learned that the Justice Department had cautioned against releasing a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/01/devin-nunes-house-intelligence-committee-memo\">congressional memo</a> detailing alleged abuses by the F.B.I., convinced that the letter was part of a Deep State plot against him. A certain degree of paranoia is, of course, nothing new for an administration under siege from all quarters. Whether the memo will actually vindicate the president is another matter. In recent weeks, conspiratorial thinking has overtaken parts of the G.O.P., which has whipped itself into a frenzy over unreleased allegations by Rep. <strong>Devin Nunes</strong> of a plot against the president. Now that House Republicans have voted to make the memo public, Trump’s spin machine will face the ultimate test: whether a partisan document, designed to cast the F.B.I. in the worst possible light, will actually live up to the hype.</p>\n<p>At this point, anything short of the Pentagon Papers or Operation Valkyrie would be a letdown. <strong>Sean Hannity</strong> <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/release-the-memo-mueller-russia-effects-552b2b97-93ca-4036-8b36-29aa54cc9b3e.html\">told</a> his prime-time Fox News audience that the document, which allegedly exposes wrongdoing by F.B.I. and D.O.J. officials in <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/01/carter-page-finally-realizes-he-should-stop-talking\">the decision to surveil</a> former Trump foreign-policy adviser <strong>Carter Page,</strong> would expose “the biggest political scandal in American history,” and that it will “shock the conscience” of Americans everywhere. “We’re talking about potential crimes. We’re talking about people being charged, going to jail,” he added. “It’s a scary night.” Hannity’s fellow pundits piled on, with <strong>Tucker Carlson</strong> declaring that the allegations in the memo&#8212;which he has not seen&#8212;are “more troubling than the underlying crime in Watergate” and <strong>Sebastian Gorka</strong> calling it “100 times bigger” than the abuses of power that led to the Revolutionary War. “This is our government spying on political adversaries,” he <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/cnn/rs-jan-29-2018?e=0795cd3100\">said</a>. “This is federal law-enforcement officials obstructing justice.”</p>\n<p>Monday’s vote triggered a five-day window during which Trump will either reject the memo’s release or approve it, but signs point to the latter. Last Wednesday, Chief of Staff <strong>John Kelly</strong> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/how-a-classified-four-page-russia-memo-triggered-a-political-firestorm/2018/01/29/42f94628-0516-11e8-94e8-e8b8600ade23_story.html\">reportedly</a> informed Attorney General <strong>Jeff Sessions</strong> that the White House supports the memo’s release, and Trump has <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/release-the-memo-mueller-russia-effects-552b2b97-93ca-4036-8b36-29aa54cc9b3e.html\">reportedly</a> already made up his mind to publish. As sources told Axios, Trump “believes [the memo’s contents] will solidify in the public’s mind that there’s a Deep State out to get him,” and sees its release as “vindication, despite Justice Department resistance.”</p>\n<p>In addition to approving the memo’s publication, Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee voted late Monday to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ThePlumLineGS/status/958299400886996992\">forgo</a> a briefing from F.B.I. Director <strong>Christopher Wray</strong> on the memo’s underlying sourcing, and blocked the public release of a competing report compiled by the Democrats, which has been described as a point-by-point rebuttal of the Nunes document. The panel did, however, vote to allow other House lawmakers to view the Democratic report. Democrats, who view the memo as a partisan effort to undercut the bureau’s Russia probe, expressed dismay at the ruling. “We have crossed a deeply regrettable line on this committee,”  <strong>Adam Schiff,</strong> the committee’s top-ranking Democrat, told reporters after the vote. “We had votes today to politicize the intelligence process, to prohibit the F.B.I. and the Department of Justice from expressing their concerns to our committee and to the House, and to selectively release to the public the majority’s distorted memo.”</p>\n<p>But the G.O.P.’s own stratospheric buildup could backfire. “They have so hyped this . . . that they’ve led their echo chamber into thinking that this is something extraordinary,” Schiff told Axios. “It’s incredibly misleading. I don’t think it in any way impugns the Russia investigation, or provides any basis for firing any of the personnel involved.” If the memo’s contents disappoint, Trump’s allies will be tasked with transforming feeble evidence into a convincing case&#8212;a task at which they have proven adept in the past. The president fights wars on perception, not fact, and the decision by F.B.I. Deputy Director <strong>Andrew McCabe</strong>&#8212; who has emerged as a symbol of the Deep State among Trump voters&#8212;arguably buttressed the idea that the F.B.I. is chock-full of <strong>James Comey</strong> and <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> lackeys. To win the war, perhaps all Trump needs is to tangentially confirm his base’s view that the F.B.I. and the D.O.J. are his enemies, and the Mueller investigation is too steeped in political bias to produce any legitimate findings.</p>","channel":"News","subChannel":"Politics","tags":["donald trump","devin nunes","memo","russia","f.b.i.","justice department","andrew mccabe","robert mueller","adam

Trump","body":"<p>Armies of fact-checkers massed around the State of the Union Address, seeking to evacuate truth from the encroaching rhetorical perils of <strong>Donald Trump</strong>. We&#39;ll now see if they&#39;ll slowed the perilous advance of his exaggerations and outright falsehoods.</p>\n<p>As Trump spoke for nearly 90 minutes, with Vice President <strong>Mike Pence</strong> and House Speaker <strong>Paul Ryan</strong> sitting behind him and serving as the traditional nodding bobbleheads, a notable partnership of <em>The Washington Post</em>, PolitiFact and FaceCheck.org combined for a running dissection of Trump statements.</p>\n<p>What&#39;s called FactStream was under the aegis of the Duke University Reporters&#39; Lab. As if one needed to underscore the challenge it and other fact-checkers face, one right-leaning site had already preemptively inveighed against &quot;<a href=\"https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/business/aly-nielsen/2018/01/29/liberal-foundations-behind-state-union-fact-checking\">Liberal Foundations Behind State of the Union Fact-Checking</a>.&quot;</p>\n<p>At 8:18 p.m. came this from the truth-seekers: &quot;Donald Trump: &quot;Since the election, we have created 2.4 million new jobs.&quot; Then, &quot;Our Quick Take: In Trump&#39;s first 11 months, employment increased by 1.84 million---12% lower than the 2 million jobs that were created the previous 11 months.&quot;</p>\n<p>At 8:22: &quot;Donald Trump: We enacted the biggest tax cuts and reform in American history.&quot; Then, &quot;Our Quick Take: It is not the biggest tax cut. It is the 8th largest cut since 1918 as a percentage of gross domestic product, and the 4th largest in inflation-adjusted dollars.&quot;</p>\n<p>In obvious ways, the hour-long instant analysis was remarkable in its speed and sophisticated concision. I thought back to sitting in the House of Representatives for many State of the Unions, in the balcony above the rostrum, a paper copy of speech in hand, jotting notes in margins, underlining phrases, sticking question marks here and there. And waiting to make calls later at the office, perhaps assisted by an Associated Press analysis of certain claims.</p>\n<p>Now a confluence of forces&#8212;most accelerated by Trump&#39;s pugilistic battle with veracity&#8212;prompts new systems melding journalists and technology. There&#39;s no need to wait hours until morning newspaper editions, or initial wire service stories. Cadres of single-minded analysts are in place, unleashed on every presidential declaration.</p>\n<p>For sure, this was never likely to be a Trumpian atrocity, and it was not. Dozens in the White House and across multiple cabinet departments typically vet the State of the Union Address. The new armies will be better off dissecting spontaneous Trump tweets and interviews in coming days, as underscored in the eviscerations by <strong>Stephen Colbert</strong> and others of his most recent unbridled interview, in Davos, Switzerland, with bombastic British talk host <strong>Piers Morgan</strong>.</p>\n<p>“This speech was way too pre-filtered for fact-checking to play an important early role in its analysis. MSNBC did a fact check segment at 8:50 pm. They make a few good points, but they’re not really helpful in assessing the speech,” said <strong>Bruno Cohen</strong>, a retired broadcast network executive who ran major network stations.</p>\n<p>“Trump’s writers managed to keep him on task&#8212;i.e. reach for some form of  unity.  The truly divisive stuff was minimized.  Only a short mention of the wall.  No attacks on the press. But, of course, he couldn’t help himself&#8212;and so we get the lines like standing for the National Anthem.”</p>\n<p>But there remained grist for the new candor-driven mills now personified by the rollout of FactStream. Had Trump eliminated, as he claimed, more regulations in just a year than any administration in history? Well, not necessarily.</p>\n<p>Have three million workers received tax cut bonuses? Yes, “with most getting $1,000 or less,” said the Duke trio. That construction (as opposed to perhaps saying “nearly $1,000”) might prompt an inference that it constitutes small potatoes. Many Americans, if not the same elite journalists who by and large missed the partly economics-driven unrest propelling Trump&#39;s stunning election victory, would surely dispute that.</p>\n<p>Had the Empire State Building been constructed in one year? Well, no, it was actually 13 months, but that check seemed a difference without a real distinction. Is Diversity Visa a program that randomly distributes green cards without regard for skill? Not quite since, among green cardholders, a high percentage holds professional jobs and has a low unemployment rate.</p>\n<p>Had Trump quickly responded when street protests broke out in Iran against the government? True, said the trio, the administration quickly and strongly condemned the arrests of protesters.</p>\n<p>The impact? It might be negligible, given these ideologically charged times and the paucity of the beyond-the-pale sentiments that can be uttered by Trump. One was reminded early of those as Trump entered the chamber and shook hands, with at least superficially mutual conviviality, with Illinois Sen. <strong>Dick Durbin</strong>, who was at the famous “shithole countries” meeting and was unrelenting in his subsequent derision of Trump.</p>\n<p>It is thus also worthy of note that, as FactStream did its thing, the White House press office was cranking out its own stream of press releases on multiple Trump statements with divergent, supporting arguments.</p>\n<p>It does, one is reminded, still have a pretty big megaphone as it seeks to drown out the dissonant refrains of the fact checkers in a time of unsettlingly low approval ratings for the press. And, of course, one watched the speech and inspected the fact-checks while confronting the likelihood, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/01/why-trump-state-of-the-union-will-be-utterly-meaningless\">nicely distilled</a> by <strong>Peter Hamby</strong> in <em>Vanity Fair</em>, that the whole affair was somewhat meaningless.</p>\n<p>Nothing that Trump would say, Hamby notes, would be as memorable as one of many Trump tweets. He&#39;s probably right: Even more in the Age of Trump, an increasingly inconsequential ritual is even more hollow. Dissections, no matter how well-intentioned and accurate, may go for naught.</p>\n<p><strong>Bipartisan, unifying?</strong></p>\n<p>No sooner had President Trump concluded than the cascade of State of the Union analysis began. Dozens and dozens of voices, many so predictable and akin to some rapid-fire mix tape of political jabber, and unavoidably raising a question broached at a recent Chicago event by MSNBC&#39;s <strong>Lawrence O&#39;Donnell</strong>: are we better served by political coverage today compared to 1968 (the subject of a new book of his) when there were no cable news channels, internet, laptops and cell phones? He says no.</p>\n<p><strong>Chris Wallace</strong> of Fox News didn&#39;t buy the pre-speech spin&#8212;and there is <em>always</em> White House pre-speech spin that proves to be largely baloney, especially about eschewing a &quot;laundry list&quot; of proposals and alleged achievements&#8212;about a bipartisan speech and found Trump offering Democrats various deals &quot;he knew they couldn&#39;t accept.&quot;</p>\n<p>And Fox&#39;s <strong>Megyn Kelly</strong>&#8212;wait, she&#39;s on NBC now and was a member of a secondary MSNBC panel that included NBC <em>eminence grise</em> <strong>Tom Brokaw</strong>&#8212;opined that if Trump gets billions for his wall, that will inevitably help him politically. The substance of the claim seemed less telling than the ancillary role she played compared to days of big event stardom at the House that Ailes Built.</p>\n<p>If only NBC had inserted <strong>Jane Fonda</strong> next to her for Round 2 (or is it Round 3) of their duel, so far most vividly marked by Kelly&#39;s gratuitous shots at a figure whose cultural impact she can only dream of replicating. On this night, Kelly was a bit player lost amid the strong first-team and bench of new colleagues.</p>\n<p><strong>The new post-speech analyses</strong></p>\n<p>The old way of doing business was personified by CNN, whose production structure can make it difficult to watch, with too many people talking, too many panels, no one person seemingly in charge (though <strong>Anderson Cooper</strong> does try), no cohesive approach. Once again, there were far too many people on the set competing for time, as if this were a UN General Assembly meeting. Why not just take a few people&#8212;including <strong>Jake Tapper</strong>, <strong>John King</strong> and <strong>David Axelrod</strong>, among others&#8212;and focus on their takes? The few really informative moments included Tapper&#39;s interview of California Sen. <strong>Kamala Harris</strong>, touching on Black Caucus reaction and what&#39;s up in the Senate Intelligence Committee</p>\n<p>If you had doubts about the new media competition, you just had to turn to <strong>Stephen Colbert&#39;s</strong> show, which is usually taped in late afternoon-early evening, and Comedy Central, which both had live shows. Colbert&#39;s effort was especially impressive in quickly and satirically editing speech video to mock Trump, then his mocking it all in a seamless monologue that came off as if meticulously rehearsed multiple times. Even for a professional stand-up comic, this error-free performance was rapier-sharp and impressive.</p>\n<p>One of many examples came as he showed Trump noting some of the natural disasters experienced in the past year, notably &quot;floods, fires and storms.&quot; Colbert then declared, &quot;And Stormys. Don&#39;t forget her. She was one of the most expensive disasters for you, personally.&quot;</p>\n<p>When a former Obama speechwriter-guest later noted the plodding delivery of the 5,000-plus words, Colbert noted Trump seemingly slowing down near the end. &quot;It seemed like somebody should pull the string in his back one more time.&quot;</p>\n<p><strong>Richard Engel&#39;s toughest story</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Richard Engel</strong>, a terrific and nervy NBC reporter, was covering the North Korea missiles mess last fall, embedded with South Korean troops, when he was contacted by his two-year-old son Henry&#39;s doctor and informed of the explanation for some seeming developmental challenges. Genetic testing showed Rett Syndrome, a rare and pretty awful disorder that guarantees significant physical and cognitive impairments. Angel, 44, and his wife, Mary, realized, “My son is probably not going to walk, probably not going to speak, probably not going to have any mental capacity beyond the level of a 2-year-old,” as he tells People magazine in an upcoming story. Imagine to returning to your seat in a convoy after that news even if the saga involves a dictator with dangerous weapons dueling with a mercurial U.S. president.</p>\n<p>“It was the middle of the night, and the public affairs officer was talking to keep us awake, telling us about her son joining the football team, and taking the SATs. I was thinking, ‘There’s going to be no football team. There’s going to be no SATs.’ I started to really mourn the future I thought we were going to have with Henry.”</p>\n<p>A genetic draw has dealt them an awful card. You may know people in a similar situation. We should mull those cases more often. I was pissed at a bunch of ultimately insignificant matters yesterday when an NBC publicist brought this tale to my attention. I realized how damn lucky I am.</p>\n<p>If you do want to reach out to Engel, or just learn more about the topic, <a href=\"https://www.duncannri.org\">go here</a>. And next time you see one of his inevitably solid reports, you might just mull his incredible challenge in compartmentalizing so much personal pain.</p>\n<p><strong>Now there&#39;s counter-programming!</strong></p>\n<p>Oh, click the clicker during the State of the Union and, la voila!, one found <em>King Kong</em> (1933) on TCM. You could now watch it knowing the Empire State Building that Kong scaled was built in 12 months. Oops, thirteen.</p>\n<p><strong>Bankrupt in Charlston</strong></p>\n<p>It&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.wvgazettemail.com/news/gazette-mail-declaring-bankruptcy-wheeling-newspapers-is-planned-buyer/article_5a0e1ede-29aa-5866-ab47-7b9655a0d3bb.html?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=user-share\">a painful West Virginia</a> story to report about yourself: &quot;The owners of the <em>Charleston Gazette-Mail</em> agreed Monday to take the company into Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Wheeling Newspapers is currently the high bidder to assume ownership of the company....In April, the Gazette-Mail and reporter Eric Eyre received the Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting for coverage of the state’s opioid crisis.&quot;</p>\n<p>It&#39;s a good paper, with a good editor and hard-working staff---none of which guarantees success amid the industry implosion. One can only cross your fingers on their behalf.</p>\n<p><strong>Trafficking in children</strong></p>\n<p>On the heels of national attention for the paper&#39;s work on sexual assault in gymnastics, <em>Indianapolis Star</em> columnist <strong>Tim Swarens</strong> has started <a href=\"https://www.indystar.com/story/opinion/columnists/tim-swarens/2018/01/30/exploited-human-trafficking-project-who-buys-child-sex-otherwise-ordinary-men/949512001/\">a 10-part series</a> on the lucrative enterprise of abusing and buying and trafficking in children. It&#39;s not a brand-new topic and there have been new laws put in place, but there are horrendous shortcomings, as he details. This was supported by a $75,000 fellowship from the Society of Professional Journalists, and added help from Google, Indianapolis powerhouse Eli Lilly and Co., and Indiana Wesleyan University.</p>\n<p>&quot;About 10,000 children a year suffer the horrors of commercial sexual exploitation in the United States. Globally, according to the International Labour Organization, buyers pay to abuse more than 1 million children a year. Yet the buyers are seldom held accountable. Most leave behind their victims to blend back into their families, jobs and neighborhoods. Until the next time.&quot;</p>\n<p><strong>The Post (non-Hollywood version)</strong></p>\n<p>Negotiations are underway on a new union contract at <em>The Washington Post</em>, with newsroom employees changing their avatars (to &quot;WAPO UNION&quot;) Tuesday in support of the union and specific items that, in their minds, have not improved during the paper&#39;s editorial renaissance under <strong>Jeff Bezos</strong> ownership.</p>\n<p>A lot of folks are tweeting their feelings, which clearly mix with pride in that editorial turnaround.</p>\n<p>Tweeted reporter <strong>Ashley Parker</strong>: &quot;I started at the Post last Jan. and I cannot overstate how much I love working here. However, during orientation when I learned about the 1% 401K match, I was convinced I&#39;d misheard &#8212; and emailed HR to double check. @PostGuild is fighting for that and more this week. #WaPoStrong.&quot;</p>\n<p>Reporter <strong>David Nakamura</strong> wrote: &quot;I grew up reading the Post, worked here in college and have been here ever since. It’s part of me and vice versa. I’m also old enough to remember when we had a 4% match and a generous pension I spent more than 20 years accruing before it ended.&quot;</p>\n<p>Post reporter <strong>Monica Hesse</strong> wrote: &quot;I love working for the @washingtonpost, and I&#39;ve been extremely proud of our journalism. However, there&#39;s no pension for new hires and we only have a 1% 401K match. The @PostGuild is bargaining for all of us this week. Wish us luck #WaPoStrong.&quot;</p>\n<p>Here&#39;s where you can find <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PostGuild/\">all their tweets</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>The Morning Babel (State of Union edition)</strong></p>\n<p><em>Trump &amp; Friends</em> was ebullient, hailing a justifiable &quot;victory lap&quot; taken by Trump in an address, intoned <strong>Ainsley Earhardt</strong>, could be summed up thus: &quot;America, America, America.&quot; It wasn&#39;t just a laundry list, said her colleague <strong>Steve Doocy</strong>, &quot;but last night we heard so much about the people and it was so interesting.&quot;</p>\n<p>CNN&#39;s <em>New Day</em> conceded the speech was &quot;for him well delivered&quot; and that he will continue to be &quot;unpredictable and impetuous,&quot; as <strong>Chris Cillizza</strong> put it in a succinct reflection of the overriding conventional wisdom on Trump himself.</p>\n<p>And <em>Morning Joe</em> on MSNBC pivoted quickly from the speech---seemingly realizing it didn&#39;t really provide the usual Trump outrages---to the show&#39;s recent red meat of wayward Republicans, notably the House Intelligence Committee heading to reveal a classified memo.</p>\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s just disgraceful,&quot; said analyst <strong>John Heilemann</strong>. &quot;This is so mind-boggling, what the Republicans are doing,&quot; interjected <strong>Joe Scarborough</strong>. Everybody on set agreed. Quelle surprise, as the French would say. It then broke for commercials, including ones for Cadillac, <em>The Shape of Water</em> and, yes, Trump&#39;s impeachment as urged by <strong>Tom Steyer</strong>, a billionaire hedge fund manager and environmental activist.

handsome and preppily primped, Evan Spiegel looks every bit the part of the privileged Pacific Palisades-raised, Crossroads then Stanford-educated son of a pair of high-powered attorneys. Spiegel grew up in an affluent world resplendent with multimillion-dollar homes, Lexuses, private-club memberships, personal chefs, and spring breaks in Maui.\n<p>At Stanford, Spiegel joined Kappa Sigma, where he organized ragers and e-blasted his bros such indelicate commandments as “put your large kappa sigma dick down her throat.” (He later apologized after Valleywag leaked a few of those e-mails, admitting to Business Insider that he was “mortified and embarrassed” by them). But instead of beelining it to Wall Street, as many self-respecting privileged frat boys might, Spiegel dropped out of Stanford&#8212;weeks shy of graduation&#8212;to launch an app with two fellow Kappa Sigma brothers, Bobby Murphy and Reggie Brown.</p>\n<p>The prototype they came up with was called Picaboo. The premise was simple: people could send one another photos that would self-destruct 10 seconds after being viewed. The advantage for the Anthony Weiners of the world is obvious. Critics, however, quickly pointed out workarounds to the disappearing act, such as screenshots and third-party apps, forcing Snapchat to settle charges with the F.T.C. that it had mislead users.</p>\n<p>Despite the early privacy hiccups, Snapchat has continued to thrive, rolling out messaging and then video chat features (with a range of hokey visual effects available to users with time to burn) and, of course, extremely coveted partnerships with media brands, known as Discover channels. Spiegel even turned down an eye-popping $3 billion offer from Mark Zuckerberg in 2013 to buy Snapchat.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Spiegel seems to possess Zuckerberg’s extraordinary aptitude for not only technology but also business development. Snapchat’s video views have grown at a dizzying pace, recently climbing as high as 10 billion a day, according to Bloomberg. (Facebook recently reported eight billion daily video views). The company has finally started to attract some serious ad revenue&#8212;$300 million is projected for this year&#8212;and was recently valued at $16 billion. After he rejected Zuckerberg’s offer, <em>Forbes</em> predicted Spiegel would “either become the next great billionaire prodigy or the ultimate cautionary tale of youthful hubris.” Looks like Spiegel is already well on his way to the former.</p>","socialMedia":[],"photos":{"tout":[{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/06/01/574f4833ee949d2f61432486_hive-contributor-profile-evan-spiegel.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"June 1, 2016 4:40 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Kelly Butler","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-evan-spiegel.jpg","_embedded":{"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[]},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-evan-spiegel.jpg","credit":"By Michael Kovac/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"574f4832b58adb2f614da237","createdAt":"June 1, 2016 4:40 pm","revision":2,"modifiedAt":"June 1, 2016 4:40 pm","contributors":{}}]},"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","url":"/people/evan-spiegel","mainPhotoContributors":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/06/01/574f4833ee949d2f61432486_hive-contributor-profile-evan-spiegel.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"June 1, 2016 4:40 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Kelly Butler","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-evan-spiegel.jpg","_embedded":{"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[]},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-evan-spiegel.jpg","credit":"By Michael Kovac/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"574f4832b58adb2f614da237","createdAt":"June 1, 2016 4:40 pm","revision":2,"modifiedAt":"June 1, 2016 4:40 pm","contributors":{}}}],"contributorsAuthor":[],"contributorsPhotographer":[],"publishHistory":{"entityId":"574f483fbdf148e4205f29e6","revision":0,"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","revisionAuthor":"Charles Truelson","searchable":true,"expired":false,"createdAt":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","uri":"people/evan-spiegel"},"related":[{}]},"relatedItems":{"items":[{"revisionAuthor":"Maya Kosoff","hed":"Did Evan Spiegel Just Nuke Snapchat’s Comeback?","body":"<p>After a year-long spiral marked by the creeping deterioration of its stock price, last week Snap, parent company of Snapchat, finally seemed to have stanched the bleeding. The company <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/02/spiegel-and-dorsey-take-a-bite-out-of-zuckerberg\">announced</a> in its quarterly earnings that it had added 9 million new daily active users and that its revenue had grown 104 percent year over year. Wall Street responded with a long-abandoned enthusiasm: Snap’s stock rose from $14 per share to $21 per share in 24 hours, nearly back to its original rosy opening price. (Today the euphoria has dissipated, but Snap is still hovering at about $18 a share.) The dramatic reversal was proof to some that Spiegel’s overhaul of Snapchat’s app, which he <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/11/evan-spiegel-announces-snapchat-redesign-amid-brutal-earnings-report\">announced</a> last year in the midst of the downturn, had paid off, finally fending off Facebook’s encroach and mounting accusations that Snapchat was old news. But in recent weeks, grassroots backlash to the redesign has reached such a pitch that it may backfire, hindering Snap’s growth at a pivotal moment.</p>\n<p>Many of the harshest critics of the redesign are the app’s most loyal users, who say the new interface is confusing and cluttered, and that sharing messages with friends is more difficult, as is tracking incoming messages. Perhaps most crucially for an app that values interpersonal, one-to-one communication, the new redesign has caused some users to lose their highly valued “streaks” (a feature that shows how many days in a row two users have sent snaps back and forth). A host of design changes&#8212;including designating one section for content from friends, and the other half for content from media companies&#8212;have left users distraught.</p>\n<p>More than 600,000 users <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/snap-inc-remove-the-new-snapchat-update\">have signed</a> a Change.org petition to remove Snapchat’s latest update. “Many ‘new features’ are useless or defeats [sic] the original purposes Snapchat has had for the past years,” the petition reads. A fake viral tweet purporting to be a Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/isaacsvobodny/status/961816896059277313\">direct-message conversation</a> between Snapchat and user <strong>Isaac Svobodny,</strong> in which the company promises to reconsider the app’s format, racked up over 1.3 million re-tweets in a matter of days. Celebrities like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chrissyteigen/status/961991076310540289\"><strong>Chrissy Teigen</strong></a> and YouTube stars like <strong>Marques Brownlee</strong> have <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-DfipidnOE\">voiced</a> their displeasure with the update, transmitting their annoyance to their audiences of millions&#8212;“How many people have to hate an update for it to be reconsidered?” Teigen asked rhetorically. Upset users have shared <a href=\"https://twitter.com/p9rooks/status/962834472663175168\">hacks</a> to retrieve the older version of the app, and a 17-year-old user from San Carlos, California, <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/snapchats-new-update-triggers-revolt-by-millions-of-teens?ref=scroll\">called</a> the app “the most disliked update since the beginning of Snapchat,” adding, “although Snapchat is my most used app on my phone, I have been using it considerably less since the update and am seriously considering deleting the app.”</p>\n<p>Snapchat has so far stood by the redesign, telling <a href=\"http://variety.com/2018/digital/news/snapchat-app-resign-backlash-users-1202695074/\"><em>Variety</em></a> in a statement that “updates as big as this one can take a little getting used to, but we hope the community will enjoy it once they settle in.” But this newest disruption comes just as the app is showing signs of luring a younger audience away from Facebook, giving <strong>Mark Zuckerberg</strong> a taste of his own medicine&#8212;a <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/12/facebook-is-losing-younger-users-to-snapchat-according-to-a-study.html\">study</a> by marketing firm eMarketer suggests that less than half of 12- to 17-year-old Americans will use Facebook at least once a month this year, and that in 2018 Facebook will lose 2 million users under the age of 25. Snapchat, the firm predicts, will add 1.9 million users in that same age bracket. Should the torrent of displeasure continue, however, Snap may be forced to re-examine its growth expectations. “A lot of teens have been super invested in Snapchat for a long time, but this update just makes the app difficult to use,” <strong>Maxine Marcus,</strong> the 17-year-old C.E.O. and founder of consulting firm the Ambassadors Company <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/snapchats-new-update-triggers-revolt-by-millions-of-teens?ref=scroll\">told</a> the Daily Beast. “I don’t think teens will abandon Snapchat, but I definitely think this will make us use it less.”</p>","channel":"News","subChannel":"Tech","tags":["snapchat","user","evan spiegel","facebook","nuke"],"ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"dek":"An update widely loathed by its most loyal users could destroy the goodwill Snap has cultivated on Wall Street.","seoTitle":"Did Evan Spiegel Just Nuke Snapchat’s Comeback?","seoDescription":"An update widely loathed by its most loyal users could destroy the goodwill Snap has cultivated on Wall Street.","socialTitle":"Did Evan Spiegel Just Nuke Snapchat’s Comeback?","socialDescription":"An update widely loathed by its most loyal users could destroy the goodwill Snap has cultivated on Wall Street.","issueDate":"","rubric":"Oh Snap","promoHed":"Did Evan Spiegel Just Nuke Snapchat’s Comeback?","promoDek":"An update widely loathed by its most loyal users could destroy the goodwill Snap has cultivated on Wall Street.","id":"5a821da57d9068584d650d48","revision":4,"createdAt":"February 12, 2018 6:05 pm","modifiedAt":"February 12, 2018 6:32 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"February 12, 2018 6:32 pm","_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Maya Kosoff","filename":"Spiegel-Snapchat-Fail-Again.jpg","aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1544,"height":1029,"format":"JPEG","duration":null,"url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2018/02/12/5a821fc7bd28cc578e6d828b_Spiegel-Snapchat-Fail-Again.jpg"},"3:2":{"override":false,"height":1028,"width":1542,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1028,"width":1542,"x":1,"y":0}},"duration":null},"5:3":{"override":false,"height":924,"width":1540,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":924,"width":1540,"x":2,"y":0}},"duration":null},"2:3":{"override":false,"height":1029,"width":686,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1029,"width":686,"x":429,"y":0}},"duration":null},"9:16":{"override":false,"height":1024,"width":576,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1024,"width":576,"x":484,"y":0}},"duration":null},"7:3":{"override":false,"height":660,"width":1540,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":660,"width":1540,"x":2,"y":0}},"duration":null},"16:9":{"override":false,"height":864,"width":1536,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":864,"width":1536,"x":4,"y":0}},"duration":null},"4:3":{"override":false,"height":1029,"width":1372,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1029,"width":1372,"x":86,"y":0}},"duration":null},"1:1":{"override":false,"height":1029,"width":1029,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1029,"width":1029,"x":257.5,"y":0}},"duration":null}},"title":"SNAP IPO","credit":"By Michael Nagle/Bloomberg/Getty Images.","cropMode":"TOP","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":true,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":false},"restrictCropping":false,"id":"5a821fc7bd28cc578e6d828c","revision":1,"createdAt":"February 12, 2018 6:14 pm","modifiedAt":"February 12, 2018 6:14 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"February 12, 2018 6:14 pm","tags":[],"altText":"SNAP IPO","description":"Getty; 647165314","modelName":"photo","collection":"photos"}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Maya Kosoff","name":"Maya Kosoff","bio":"Maya Kosoff writes about tech for VF.com.

Well, that’s more or less how <strong>Evan Spiegel,</strong> the co-founder and C.E.O. of Snap, felt this week. Snap, which has been fighting uphill against the narrative that it’s no longer cool, and no longer growing, and a victim of Instagram’s phenomenal growth, turns out to be alive and well. Earlier this week, the company announced that it added <a href=\"http://adage.com/article/digital/snapchat-reports-9-million-daily-users-ad-surge/312286/\">9 million daily active users</a>, bringing its total audience up to 187 million people per day, defying virtually all expectations. Furthermore, Snap’s revenue grew 104 percent from a year earlier, which offered a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/07/do-not-bet-against-snapchat-and-evan-spiegel\">stark rebuke</a> to those who predicted, as recently as a year ago, that it was toast and would be sold off for parts. As a result of all this good fortune, Snap’s stock rose with the velocity of Falcon Heavy, rising from $14 a share to $21 in a single 24-hour period, making up for several months of losses, and returning the company’s market capitalization to $25 billion. The company is now on par with Twitter, which also saw its stock and market value shoot up this week after a similarly impressive, and surprising, quarterly earnings report.</p>\n<p>This auspicious twist of fate for both Twitter and Snap concurred, it must be noted, with Facebook’s announcement that the platform shed nearly one million daily active users in the United States and Canada during the course of the same quarter. Coincidence? Maybe, but also a slap in the face for Facebook&#8212;get it, slap in the face?!&#8212;which spent the past decade trying to buy or destroy Twitter, and almost all of last year copying Snap and its features in an attempt to vanquish the popular upstart. This recent good news certainly doesn’t mean that Snap is in the clear, or that 2018 will be a rollicking year for Spiegel. It also doesn’t mean that <strong>Jack Dorsey</strong> can look forward to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jack/status/961630471854604288\">issuing self-congratulatory tweets</a> for the next four business quarters. As anyone who has competed with <strong>Mark Zuckerberg</strong> knows, he fights to the death, and squishes people and companies without much fanfare. If they’re still alive after Zuckerberg’s first attempt, he keeps belting away at them.</p>\n<p>Yet this reputation didn’t stop Spiegel, who knew he couldn’t prevent Facebook from stealing his ideas. Instead, he decided to double-down on what Snap does best: product design. As a result, Snap has redesigned its app, made it simpler and more intuitive (though some users think it’s more complicated), and begun a huge push to recruit new users on the Android platform. Twitter, on the other hand, has focused on what it’s good at, too: letting people yell at each other in the simplest and most concise way possible. (Just look at the replies to Dorsey’s congratulatory tweet to the Twitter team to see exactly what I mean, with most responses telling Dorsey to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/geoffgolberg/status/961632308494323712\">“remove your head from your ass, dude,”</a> or to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mdcanniff/status/961693395835129860\">“Ban Trump.”</a>)</p>\n<p>Of course, Dorsey, Zuckerberg, and Spiegel all know that they are still at the beginning of a long battle for social-media dominance, as competition intensifies, audiences migrate to other pleasures, and a concerned public wonders if such products are facilitating the demise of our culture. And Spiegel could soon face challenges that make a scrap with Zuckerberg feel like a playground tussle. Snap reported on its earnings call that it had losses amounting to around $350 million for this past quarter against revenue of $286 million, up from $208 million the quarter earlier. This was one reason the stock went straight upwards after earnings; stock analysts <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/snap-earnings-what-to-watch-1517913001\">had been expecting</a> a loss of around $409 million, with around $255 million in quarterly revenue. Most of those costs&#8212;around $131 million&#8212;came from all the photos and videos Snap has to host, according to the <a href=\"https://investor.snap.com/~/media/Files/S/Snap-IR/reports-and-presentations/q4-17-earnings-slides.pdf\">company’s presentation</a>, which means Snap also has an obvious avenue to pare its losses. But if those hundreds of millions of dollars in expenses don’t start to come down and meet revenue, which so far is going up, investors will become very unhappy, very quickly. This, of course, is a reality that Dorsey knows a thing or two about.</p>\n<p>Spiegel has other problems, too. Snap’s core users are largely teenagers, who have about as much allegiance to a platform as <strong>Donald Trump</strong> does to his White House staff. These teens can jump from one service to another like a flock of starlings in murmuration, and Snap remains at constant risk of losing business to the next shiny thing. Just ask Twitter what that’s like, too: the company has had well over a billion people sign up for Twitter, only to see hundreds of millions leave and never come back. Twitter, it should also be noted, is a company that went public in 2013 and only became profitable for the first time just this week.</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>These latest various earnings reports suggest many things about these incipient platforms, but tantamount among them is just how little Wall Street understands about valuing social-media start-ups. In the early days of social media, before anyone made any real money, these companies were valued by the number of people who had signed up for the service. Then Wall Street and venture investors paid attention to the number of people who used the platform every month. Then it was the number of people who logged in every day. Then it was the number of people who logged in on their phones. Then the company’s revenue. Then profit.</p>\n<p>Now, a decade later, it seems that the way Wall Street chooses to value social networks is directly correlated with what investors think is the best bet for that moment. For now, it seems that the success of Snap, Twitter, and Facebook (and in turn Instagram) are all inter-related with each other. If one company’s user growth goes down, another’s goes up. In retrospect, it’s all a bit of a shame. The race for growth, funded by the desire for a market capitalization, indisputably helped pave the way for a world in which many of these platforms are <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/02/nick-bilton-reveals-the-truth-about-twitters-dirty-secret\">commandeered by bots and trolls</a>, and where an example of the latter is our president. To hear it from these companies’ founders, they have learned from their past mistakes and are going to try and ensure that the atrocities of the 2016 election don’t happen again. I sincerely hope that Wall Street makes an attempt to value these social giants based on how much they follow through on that promise.</p>\n</section>","channel":"News","subChannel":"Business","tags":[],"ledeCaption":"Evan Spiegel, Mark Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey.","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"dek":"Snap and Twitter’s unexpectedly buoyant earnings have sent their stocks soaring at a time when Facebook seems increasingly vulnerable.

Threatens Leakers with Jail Time","body":"<p>At Snapchat’s sprawling Los Angeles campus, a culture of secrecy is more than just the byproduct of its rapid expansion, which has divided employees into multiple buildings across downtown Venice. It’s baked into the company from the top down. Product, sales, and engineering teams are siloed from one another, sometimes leaving workers in the dark until new initiatives are made public. And C.E.O. <strong>Evan Spiegel,</strong> one of the few people who knows exactly what is next for the company, keeps his cards close to his vest&#8212;<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/10/evan-spiegel-doesnt-regret-taking-snapchat-public\">even from investors</a>. “Keeping secrets gives you space to change your mind, until you’re really sure that you’re right,” he <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2015-05-26/evan-spiegel-reveals-plan-to-turn-snapchat-into-a-real-business\">wrote</a> in a 2015 note to employees. When Snap filed for its I.P.O., it was reluctant to release information that it wasn’t legally obligated to cough up, forcing Wall Street to have faith in Spiegel’s vision.</p>\n<p>That culture, apparently, can also manifest itself in more aggressive ways. Taking a move straight from <strong>Anthony Scaramucci’s</strong> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/07/anthony-scaramucci-fire-everybody\">political playbook</a>, in which Trump’s briefly tenured communications director threatened to “f-----g kill all the leakers” in the White House, Snapchat parent company Snap Inc. has issued a remarkable advisory against employees speaking to reporters. “If you leak Snap Inc. information, you will lose your job and we will pursue any and all legal remedies against you,” Snap general counsel <strong>Michael O’Sullivan</strong> warned in a memo <a href=\"https://cheddar.com/videos/exclusive-snap-threatens-jail-time-for-leakers\">obtained by Cheddar</a> and published on Friday. “And that’s just the start,” it continues, warning that employees could face personal financial liability. “The government, our investors, and other third parties can also seek their own remedies against you for what you disclosed. The government can even put you in jail.”</p>\n<p>The memo was sent to employees last week, shortly before the Daily Beast <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/this-is-the-data-snapchat-doesnt-want-you-to-see\">published</a> a trove of internal user data. Some of the metrics&#8212;including details on daily Snap Story usage and Snap Map usage&#8212;have declined in recent months, which is believed to be the reason Spiegel announced a <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2018/01/09/snapchat-internal-data-leaks/\">sweeping redesign</a> late last year. Snap’s sagging stock price may also help explain O’Sullivan’s crackdown. Snap <a href=\"https://cheddar.com/videos/exclusive-snap-lays-off-two-dozen-employees\">laid off</a> two dozen employees this week, including some of the company’s content-division workers, who focused on working with publishing partnerships to produce content for Snapchat’s Discover section.</p>\n<p>“We have a zero-tolerance policy for those who leak Snap Inc. confidential information,” O’Sullivan said in the memo. “This applies to outright leaks and any informal ‘off the record’ conversations with reporters, as well as any confidential information you let slip to people who are not authorized to know that information.” Snap, reached for comment, did not respond on the record.</p>","channel":"News","subChannel":"Tech","tags":["snapchat","employee","memo","general counsel","leakers","scaramucci"],"ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"dek":"A memo from Snap’s general counsel suggests employees who speak to the press will lose their jobs, and then some.","seoTitle":"Snapchat Goes Full Scaramucci, Threatens Leakers with Jail Time","seoDescription":"A memo from Snap’s general counsel suggests employees who speak to the press will lose their jobs, and then some.","socialTitle":"Snapchat Goes Full Scaramucci, Threatens Leakers with Jail Time","socialDescription":"A memo from Snap’s general counsel suggests employees who speak to the press will lose their jobs, and then some.","issueDate":"","rubric":"Snapped","promoHed":"Snapchat Goes Full Scaramucci, Threatens Leakers with Jail Time","promoDek":"A memo from Snap’s general counsel suggests employees who speak to the press will lose their jobs, and then some.","id":"5a626a33ed2de06615787453","revision":5,"createdAt":"January 19, 2018 4:59 pm","modifiedAt":"January 19, 2018 5:35 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"January 19, 2018 5:35 pm","_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Maya Kosoff","filename":"Evan-Spiegel-Snapchat 2.jpg","aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":2000,"height":1333,"format":"JPEG","duration":null,"url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2018/01/19/5a626c8aed2de06615787454_Evan-Spiegel-Snapchat%202.jpg"},"3:2":{"override":false,"height":1332,"width":1998,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1332,"width":1998,"x":1,"y":0}},"duration":null},"5:3":{"override":false,"height":1200,"width":2000,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1200,"width":2000,"x":0,"y":0}},"duration":null},"2:3":{"override":false,"height":1332,"width":888,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1332,"width":888,"x":556,"y":0}},"duration":null},"9:16":{"override":false,"height":1328,"width":747,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1328,"width":747,"x":626.5,"y":0}},"duration":null},"7:3":{"override":false,"height":855,"width":1995,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":855,"width":1995,"x":2.5,"y":0}},"duration":null},"16:9":{"override":false,"height":1125,"width":2000,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1125,"width":2000,"x":0,"y":0}},"duration":null},"4:3":{"override":false,"height":1332,"width":1776,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1332,"width":1776,"x":112,"y":0}},"duration":null},"1:1":{"override":false,"height":1333,"width":1333,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1333,"width":1333,"x":333.5,"y":0}},"duration":null}},"title":"775048537QS00053_Vanity_Fai","credit":"By Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images.","cropMode":"TOP","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":true,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":false},"restrictCropping":false,"id":"5a626c8aed2de06615787455","revision":1,"createdAt":"January 19, 2018 5:09 pm","modifiedAt":"January 19, 2018 5:09 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"January 19, 2018 5:09 pm","tags":[],"altText":"775048537QS00053_Vanity_Fai","description":"Getty: 857177210","modelName":"photo","collection":"photos"}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Maya Kosoff","name":"Maya Kosoff","bio":"Maya Kosoff writes about tech for VF.com.

He also said that people should acknowledge the “spectrum of behavior” when it comes to sexual misconduct, and commended <strong>Louis C.K.</strong> for confessing to the accusations against him. “We can work with that,” Damon said. “What the hell else are you supposed to do?”</p>\n<p>Now, almost exactly a month later, Damon says he regrets his comments. “I really wish I’d listened a lot more before I weighed in on this,” he told <strong>Kathie Lee Gifford</strong> on the <em>Today</em> show Tuesday morning.

Officially Coming to FX","body":"<p>It might sound like a <strong>Ryan Murphy</strong> fan’s most extravagant fever dream, but it’s official: FX has picked up <em>Pose,</em> the prolific TV maestro’s dance musical series, for an eight-episode debut season.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/03/ryan-murphy-pose-tv-show\">previously described</a> this spring when the project was first announced, <em>Pose</em> will be an ode to the opulence of 1980s New York&#8212;juxtaposing the rise of the luxury Trump-era universe, the downtown social and literary scene, and the world of drag culture. It will also feature the largest cast of transgender actors in regular series roles in scripted TV history, alongside stars <strong>Evan Peters, Kate Mara,</strong> and <strong>James Van Der Beek.</strong> (Peters and Mara, it’s worth noting, both worked with Murphy on <em>American Horror Story;</em> Peters has appeared in every season of that anthology, while Mara appeared as Hayden McClaine in Season 1.)</p>\n<p>But here&#39;s what&#39;s perhaps most interesting: one role in the series&#8212;which <strong>Tatiana Maslany</strong> was originally set to play&#8212;has been re-written and re-cast. The <em>Orphan Black</em> star <a href=\"http://ew.com/tv/2017/12/27/tatiana-maslany-exits-pose/\">had been set</a> to play a modern dance teacher, but in a press release issued Wednesday afternoon, FX noted that the role had been “reconceived and re-written to be a 50-year-old African-American woman.” <strong>Charlayne Woodard</strong> (of <em>The Leftovers, Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit,</em> and <em>ER</em>) has taken over the modified role.</p>\n<p>Peters and Mara will play a couple from New Jersey, Stan and Patty, “who get sucked into the glamour and intrigue of New York City in the 1980s.” Van Der Beek&#8212;whom viewers <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/james-van-der-beeks-cry-face-dawsons-creek-dont-trust-b-310071\">might recognize</a> from <em>Dawson’s Creek</em>&#8212;will play a character named Matt, Peters’s financial kingpin boss. The series will also co-star Tony Award winner <strong>Billy Porter</strong> and newcomers <strong>Ryan Jamaal Swain</strong> and <strong>Dyllon Burnside,</strong> alongside a historically large trans cast that includes actors <strong>M.J. Rodriguez, Dominique Jackson, Indya Moore, Hailie Sahar,</strong> and <strong>Angelica Ross.</strong> Murphy will also recruit trans directors, whom he will assist through his Directing Mentorship Program.</p>\n<p>Murphy&#8212;who co-created the series with his frequent collaborators <strong>Brad Falchuk</strong> and <strong>Steven Canals</strong>&#8212;will serve as executive producer on the series, and plans to direct the first two episodes. Two fascinating additions to his usual team? Trans rights activist <strong>Janet Mock</strong> and trans singer-songwriter and <em>Transparent</em> writer__Our Lady J,__ who will both serve as producers. It appears that, in addition to its commitment to grandeur, <em>Pose</em> also wants to make sure it tells trans stories right. Murphy himself describes the show as a “game changer . . . which at its heart is an uplifting series about the universal quest for identity, family, and respect.”</p>\n<p>“Along with being a dance musical and an affirming look at American life in the 1980s,” Murphy continued in FX’s press release, “I’m so proud that <em>Pose</em> and FX has made history right from the beginning by featuring the most trans series regular actors ever in an American television production. Additionally, the first season of <em>Pose</em> will feature 50-plus L.G.B.T.Q. characters&#8212;a record in American television history. I can’t wait for people to see this incredibly talented, passionate cast.”</p>\n<p>The series will premiere next summer.</p>","channel":"Hollywood","subChannel":"Television","tags":["ryan murphy","television","fx"],"ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"dek":"With Evan Peters, Kate Maral, and James Van Der Beek&#8212;but not Tatiana Maslany anymore.","seoTitle":"Ryan Murphy’s TV Ode to 80s New York Is Officially Coming to FX","seoDescription":"With Evan Peters, Kate Maral, and James Van Der Beek—but not Tatiana Maslany anymore.","socialTitle":"Ryan Murphy’s TV Ode to 80s New York Is Officially Coming to FX","socialDescription":"With Evan Peters, Kate Maral, and James Van Der Beek—but not Tatiana Maslany anymore.","issueDate":"","rubric":"Coming Soon","promoHed":"Ryan Murphy’s TV Ode to 80s New York Is Officially Coming to FX","promoDek":"With Evan Peters, Kate Maral, and James Van Der Beek&#8212;but not Tatiana Maslany anymore.","id":"5a44faf71f2f4325736cd7c5","revision":16,"createdAt":"December 28, 2017 9:08 am","modifiedAt":"December 28, 2017 10:52 am","revisionCreatedAt":"December 28, 2017 10:52 am","_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Laura Bradley","filename":"ryan-murphy-pose-fx.jpg","aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1440,"height":960,"format":"JPEG","duration":null,"url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2017/12/28/5a45099977bfbd53e1f5cc4c_ryan-murphy-pose-fx.jpg"},"3:2":{"override":false,"height":960,"width":1440,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":960,"width":1440,"x":0,"y":0}},"duration":null},"5:3":{"override":false,"height":864,"width":1440,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":864,"width":1440,"x":0,"y":0}},"duration":null},"2:3":{"override":false,"height":960,"width":640,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":960,"width":640,"x":400,"y":0}},"duration":null},"9:16":{"override":false,"height":960,"width":540,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":960,"width":540,"x":450,"y":0}},"duration":null},"7:3":{"override":false,"height":615,"width":1435,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":615,"width":1435,"x":2.5,"y":0}},"duration":null},"16:9":{"override":false,"height":810,"width":1440,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":810,"width":1440,"x":0,"y":0}},"duration":null},"4:3":{"override":false,"height":960,"width":1280,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":960,"width":1280,"x":80,"y":0}},"duration":null},"1:1":{"override":false,"height":960,"width":960,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":960,"width":960,"x":240,"y":0}},"duration":null}},"title":"ryan-murphy-pose-fx.jpg","cropMode":"TOP","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":true,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":false},"restrictCropping":false,"id":"5a45099977bfbd53e1f5cc4d","revision":1,"createdAt":"December 28, 2017 10:11 am","modifiedAt":"December 28, 2017 10:12 am","revisionCreatedAt":"December 28, 2017 10:12 am","credit":"By Frazer Harrison/Getty Images.","tags":[],"altText":"Ryan Murphy.","description":"getty 646912298","modelName":"photo","collection":"photos"}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Chiara Marinai","name":"Laura Bradley","bio":"Laura Bradley is a Hollywood writer for VanityFair.com.

I will not hire assholes, and if you are a bully, you won&#39;t survive here. Nobody wants to be around assholes.”</p>\n<p>This reduction to basics Tuesday was a refreshing moment at the Newseum, which is situated on Pennsylvania Avenue halfway between the Congress and the White House. And since there are so many in both of those buildings&#8212;both men and women and probably led by <strong>Donald</strong> <strong>Trump</strong>&#8212;who use the A-word about the press, it was at least atypical to hear the press use it about themselves.</p>\n<p>“We said asshole more than ever in this room,” concluded <strong>Jill Geisler</strong>, Loyola University Chicago’s Bill Plante Chair of Leadership and Media Integrity and the event&#39;s very skilled ringmaster. She had that right.</p>\n<p>The event&#39;s biggest surprise came from one of the few men in the room, namely <em>Washington Post</em> reporter <strong>Paul Farhi</strong>. He responded with open skepticism to comments by <strong>Carolyn Ryan</strong>, assistant managing editor of <em>The New York Times</em>, after she recounted the internal investigation into, and ultimate suspension, of high-profile reporter <strong>Glenn Thrush</strong> (played by <strong>Bobby Moynihan</strong> on <em>Saturday Night Live</em> before Thrush&#39;s fall from grace).</p>\n<p>In the event&#39;s one moment of vague tension, as Poynter chronicled, he questioned whether <em>The Times</em> was as transparent as Ryan intimated in its handling of the whole matter. Ryan conceded that Farhi had raised a good question but noted some understandable issues involving privacy and the confidential nature of some interviews conducted in a seemingly comprehensive probe of Thrush.</p>\n<p>There was irony in <em>The Times</em>, of all places, being so chided since it&#39;s been in the forefront of reporting on sexual harassment.It is generally rather more transparent on most matters than most organizations. But it&#39;s fallible&#8212;and its esteem surely prompts disproportionate scrutiny (and envy).</p>\n<p>By comparison, <strong>Madhulika Sikka</strong>, a media consultant and the public editor at PBS, scoffed at NBC News for its handling of the Matt Lauer debacle. That came during a session in which <strong>Charlie Rose, Garrison Keillor and Mark Halperin</strong> were among the other prominent names alluded to with implicit scorn.</p>\n<p><strong>Loren Mayor</strong>, NPR&#39;s chief operating officer, didn&#39;t explicitly cite its most prominent bad actor, former top news executive <strong>Michael Oreskes</strong>. But she didn&#39;t have to as she conceded important lessons she&#39;s learned in the aftermath of the Orestes mess: a) sexual harassment was “the tip of the iceberg” of institutional problems subsequently uncovered b) the organization is deeply splintered structurally and c) tough budget times have led to focusing on editorial dollars at the short-sighted expense of other functions, like a thinning human resources department.</p>\n<p>There was no shortage of mea culpas, insights and telling anecdotes throughout the day that had an unavoidable preaching-the-the-choir air. There was the duly noted lack of of men among the 150 or so in the room (though there was otherwise a seemingly praiseworthy mix of ages, race, media platforms, ethnicity and sexual orientation).</p>\n<p><strong>Joanne Lipman</strong>, who recently exited the top editorial post at USA TODAY to focus on an upcoming book, <em>That’s What She Said: What Men Need to Know (and Women Need to Tell Them) About Working Together</em>, spoke of the &quot;unfortunate side effects&quot; of not rallying males to the whole evolving national discussion.</p>\n<p>In the process, she said, one may “demonize perfectly good men, the good guys.” And then there are those armies of men in the media who are simply “clueless,” unaware of the issues so grotesquely obvious to their female colleagues.</p>\n<p><strong>Bye, bye Bannon</strong></p>\n<p>The media&#39;s use of middle names is usually reserved for accounts of presidential inaugurations or disclosing the identity of mass murderers. As for use of middle initials in news headlines, well, ah, you don&#39;t see it often&#8212;except apparently in corporate obituaries of disgraced and garrulous leaders of small right-wing news organizations.</p>\n<p>&quot;<strong>Stephen K. Bannon</strong> Steps Down from Breitbart News Network&quot; <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/01/09/stephen-k-bannon-steps-breitbart-news-network/\">reported</a> Breitbart.</p>\n<p>His smiling mug was at one point yesterday surrounded by not one or two but three ads for the conservative digital channel CRTV. Maybe he can get a gig discussing fake news or <strong>Michael Wolff</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Ok, so what does his exit mean for Breitbart?</strong></p>\n<p>Says <strong>Will Sommer</strong>, an editor at <em>The Hill</em> who turns out (on his own time) the <a href=\"http://tinyletter.com/rightrichter\">Right Richter newsletter</a> on conservative media:</p>\n<p>&quot;This is a blow to Breitbart, which has now lost the last thing it had differentiating itself from the competition. Before Bannon&#39;s falling out with Trump, the site looked like it had the ear of the White House. Without him, it&#39;s no different from rivals like the Daily Caller, and will struggle to stand out from the competition without the sense that it&#39;s the most Trump of the pro-Trump sites.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;But really, Breitbart&#39;s owners didn&#39;t have a choice, especially after the White House rejected Bannon&#39;s apology. There&#39;s no future for the site in criticizing Trump or his family, as Bannon did, so he had to go. Judging by the comment section, Breitbart&#39;s readers were revolting. Bannon had also strained the site&#39;s relationships with other conservative media outlets &#8212; like the Drudge Report, which can decide a lot of the traffic that goes to a site like Breitbart. From the owners&#39; perspective, Bannon had to go, but they&#39;ll take a hit over this.</p>\n<p><strong>Trump&#39;s lawyer targets BuzzFeed</strong></p>\n<p>As Bloomberg <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-10/trump-lawyer-cohen-sues-buzzfeed-over-claims-in-russia-dossier\">details</a>, &quot;<strong>Donald Trump’s</strong> personal attorney <strong>Michael Cohen</strong> sued Buzzfeed Inc. on Tuesday for defamation over allegations about him in a dossier the news organization published that was commissioned in 2016 by the president’s political opponents.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Cohen said he also filed a second defamation suit against political intelligence firm Fusion GPS, which compiled the dossier, in federal court. Buzzfeed <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/kenbensinger/these-reports-allege-trump-has-deep-ties-to-russia?utm_term=.dp5l7Kjn8#.rpd9E6pjl\">published the dossier</a> in its entirety nearly a year ago, which it said it obtained from a source it didn’t identify.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;The dossier contains unverified claims that Cohen and Trump had suspicious connections with Russian figures. Most other U.S. news organizations declined to publish the document because many of its claims&#8212;some of them salacious&#8212;haven’t been substantiated.&quot;</p>\n<p>BuzzFeed&#39;s spokesman said, &quot;We look forward to defending the free press and our First Amendment rights in court.” The attorney for Fusion GPS, which was started by former Wall Street Journal staffers, hadn&#39;t seen the suit against Fusion so couldn&#39;t comment.</p>\n<p><strong>Trump&#39;s dumb threats</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/trumps-legal-threats-against-bannon-and-wolff-are-as-empty-as-they-are-foolish\">Writing</a> in the Daily Beast, former longtime New York Times attorney <strong>George Freeman</strong> makes clear why Trump&#39;s threatened lawsuit against <strong>Michael Wolff</strong> and his publisher is b.s. And, along the way, the head of the Media Law Resource Center opines:</p>\n<p>&quot;The three antagonists, Trump, Bannon, and Wolff are all of a piece and, in a sense, all deserve each other. They are hucksters, self-promoting salesmen and, ultimately, egotistic provocateurs. This whole incident will only add to the undeserved publicity they will all receive. Moreover, while I am unaware of Bannon’s proclivities for falsehoods, Trump and Wolff have a similar, distant relationship with the truth, though Wolff’s falsities may be not as continual and blatant as the president’s.&quot;</p>\n<p><strong>Chris Christie&#39;s exit</strong></p>\n<p><em>Vice News Tonight</em> on HBO did a very nice job in <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/wjppmw/we-took-a-road-trip-across-new-jersey-to-find-out-why-chris-christie-failed\">a nine-minute piece</a>&#8212;yes, imagine a nine-minute piece on ABC, CBS or NBC evening newscasts&#8212;on the rise and fall of New Jersey Gov. <strong>Chris Christie</strong>, the outgoing leader who gave his final State of the State address to the legislature Tuesday.</p>\n<p><strong>Evan-McMorris Santoro</strong> drove all around to remind one how brash Christie went from sky-high approval after Hurricane Sandy to the least popular departing New Jersey governor ever, not to mention one the most unpopular politicians in the country. It finished with an aerial shot of the reporter alone on the same beach where Christie stupidly hung with his family during a government shutdown that closed all the beaches. Remember those images?</p>\n<p><strong>Bill Clinton and press freedom</strong></p>\n<p>If you missed it during Monday&#39;s (scintillating) college football championship game (how does Alabama recruit three of everything, including an amazing left-handed, God-fearing freshman substitute quarterback from Hawaii?), <strong>Bill Clinton</strong> tweeted this:</p>\n<p>&quot;A free press is critical to a free society&#8212;the detention of journalists anywhere is unacceptable. The Reuters journalists being held in Myanmar should be released immediately.&quot;</p>\n<p>Like all ex-presidents, his admiration for the press grows as those White House years recede into the faraway past.</p>\n<p><strong>In case you missed the Golden Globes</strong></p>\n<p>There may be few more curious journalism organizations than the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which was long a journalism laughingstock and improbably saw its awards dinner morph into a national event. Even Best Actress in a Motion Picture winner <strong>Frances McDormand</strong> expressed her befuddlement from the stage as to who they are.</p>\n<p>Well they&#39;ve traditionally been a rag tag group of folks who live in Southern California who write (sometimes infrequently) for foreign publications. Their professional distinction can be minimal and, as Vox <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/12/11/16762660/golden-globes-voting-explained-hfpa\">has noted</a>, the requirements for membership as scant. But they&#39;re generating enough income from that awards show to exhibit praiseworthy largess toward others, if not any professional distinction of its own.</p>\n<p>Thus it announced Sunday grants of $1 million each to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and the Committee to Protect Journalists. There are many worthy journalism groups and these are two, with the former having recently done the blockbuster Paradise Papers expose of tax havens.</p>\n<p><strong>The &quot;new&quot; Sports Illustrated</strong></p>\n<p>Iconic <em>Sports Illustrated</em> unveils a less frequent but what it claims will be a heftier version on Friday as the onetime weekly essentially morphs into a biweekly&#8212;and perhaps awaits a different fate when Meredith, which has been given more to running lifestyle, not news, publications takes over Time Inc. (some assume it will thus sell the likes of S.I.,Time and Fortune). <a href=\"https://www.poynter.org/news/sports-illustrated-now-reduced-biweekly-publication?utm_source=CNN+Media%3A+Reliable+Sources&amp;utm_campaign=d600248599-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2017_06_06&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_e95cdc16a9-d600248599-82045289\">Here&#39;s a look</a> at what seemingly beckons via Poynter&#39;s <strong>Rick Edmonds</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>The Morning Babel</strong></p>\n<p><em>Morning Joe</em> opened with a tweet but it wasn&#39;t a Trump tweet. No it was colleague and Washington Post reporter <strong>Robert Costa</strong>. Was he bashing Rocket Man, too? No, he&#39;d  opined,&quot;Nearly a year after talk of nationalism and revolution at the inauguration, it was reported today that President Trump will head to Davos + moved closer to a DACA deal, and Bannon is out at Breitbart.&quot;</p>\n<p><em>Trump &amp; Friends</em> didn&#39;t note any such a confluence of acts offering a dictionary definition of hypocrisy. No, it derided the unceasing narrative (thanks, <strong>Michael Wolff</strong>) of Trump as lazy, crazy and eating fast food in his bedroom. So he &quot;did something brilliant,&quot; Fox held, in having cameras stay in that meeting with congressional leaders for  55 minutes. It praised him even as the same video showed the likes of Illinois Democratic Sen. <strong>Dick Durbin</strong>, seated next to Trump, looking dyspeptic and funereal to the point of possibly verging on nausea. It did so despite the fact that Trump appeared totally malleable and contradictory on various matters, as CNN <em>New Day&#39;s</em> <strong>Alisyn Camerota</strong> noted and <em>The Washington Post</em> underscored at greater length this morning.</p>\n<p>CNN&#39;s show included <strong>Chris Cuomo&#39;s</strong> critique of the congressional interview of <strong>Glenn Simpson</strong>, the former <em>Wall Street Journal</em> reporter who is a founder of Fusion GPS, which was disclosed by Sen. <strong>Dianne Feinstein</strong>. He finds it rife with conspiracy-filled Republican interrogation of Simpson, and contends Simpson &quot;shot it (the conspiracy notions) down like a cheap carnival trick.&quot; Assuming one can shoot down cheap carnival tricks. Viewers got the point.</p>\n<p>But, wait, did that televised Trump session exhibit a &quot;stable genius&quot;? On <em>New Day</em> the Daily Beast&#39;s <strong>John Avlon</strong> said it &quot;was a great thing for the administration and the president to do, to show what he is capable of and show some delivery on the promise that he could shake things up and focus on a deal.&quot; He &quot;comported himself like a president should,&quot; added Cuomo, and exhibited &quot;a little bit of TV genius.&quot;</p>\n<p>Amid the 24/7 interviews with Michael Wolff, that&#39;s certainly a different take than the recent mantras of either CNN or MSNBC. It&#39;s one that would not reflexively be ridiculed on <em>Fox &amp; Friends</em>, a bit of analytical homogeneity that is very rare these days.</p>\n<p><strong>Tensions at the Harvard Crimson</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.poynter.org/news/harvard-journalist-wonders-can-crimson-fully-embrace-diversity\">Writes</a> student journalist <strong>Ruben Reyes</strong>, &quot;The Harvard Crimson, Harvard’s college newspaper and one of the oldest dailies in the country, is experiencing a bit of a racial reckoning. The <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/column/borderlandsla-frontera/article/2017/12/6/reyes-ortiz-our-silence/\">last article</a> my co-columnist and I wrote in the opinion section comes with an editor’s note: &#39;The Crimson is not, and has never been, a perfect institution.&#39;&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;The piece outlines the ways we, two Latinx students on substantial financial aid, and other students of color who came before us have struggled in our own newsroom because of racial micro-aggressions, push-back on pitches and an environment that siphons writers of color out of the organization.&quot;</p>\n<p><strong>An Ivanka angle missed by Big Media (including Fox)</strong></p>\n<p>&quot;Did <strong>Ivanka</strong> attend Shabbat services this past Saturday?&quot; communications strategist Beth Balsam asks in <a href=\"https://forward.com/scribe/391771/why-wont-ivanka-become-the-pharaohs-daughter-we-desperately-need/\">an op-ed</a> in the Jewish-oriented Forward. &quot;That question has been bouncing around my head since I sat in the pew and heard the rabbi talk about this past week’s parsha, Shemot, the beginning of the book of Exodus, in which Pharaoh’s daughter, in an act of great bravery, defied her father’s orders.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;You see, the evil and probably crazy Pharaoh had decreed that all male Jewish babies were to be killed. In an act of desperation, Yocheved, Moses’s mother, took her newborn son, put him in a basket and had her daughter Miriam place that basket in the Nile. Miriam watched as the Pharaoh’s daughter, who came to the Nile to bathe herself, found the basket and rescued the infant. She knew this was a Jewish baby and by taking him in, she was laying it all on the line. But she was compelled to do the right thing, the human thing. To save an innocent child. She raised him as her own and, as you know, that child was Moses, who later delivered the Israelites from slavery.&quot;</p>\n<p>Her bottom line: She mulls that unidentified woman and the compulsion to &quot;do the right things.&quot; She writes, &quot;For those of us who were dreading a Donald Trump presidency, we placed our hopes in <strong>Ivanka Trump</strong>. Would she act as Pharaoh’s daughter and defy her father in order to save the world.&quot; Ah, as she now concedes, it hasn&#39;t happened. No moral courage is displayed, at least not to this Trump critic.</p>\n<p>This is apparently the first reference to Pharaoh, or his daughter, as the press tries to make sense of what&#39;s going on in the West Wing.</p>\n<p>Corrections?

Warning to Big Tech","body":"<p>You can say this for GoPro: the company has always made a great camera. The wearable apparatus that C.E.O. <strong>Nick Woodman</strong> <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20111007055757/http://www.malakye.com/asp/front/CMSPage.asp?TYP_ID=2&amp;ID=2831\">described</a> in an early interview as “so convenient that you forget you’ve got it on,” did gangbusters, and its models are still regularly <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/photography-video-capture/cameras/gopro-generation-the-ultimate-guide-to-action-cameras-1274790\">listed</a> as some of the best. For a while, Woodman was riding high: he and his wife <strong>Jill</strong> <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/briansolomon/2014/07/01/gopro-cant-be-stopped-stock-up-over-100-from-ipo/#6e9734cf31de\">sold</a> about 3.6 million shares in the company’s 2014 I.P.O., making about $86 million pre-tax. Then, GoPro got ambitious. “We’re not just a camera anymore,” <a href=\"http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2015/09/brand-learn-from-gopro/\">said</a> <strong>Paul Crandell,</strong> the company’s S.V.P. of marketing, shortly after GoPro went public. “We’re an enjoyment platform for people around the world to watch.”</p>\n<p>In retrospect, it’s a simple matter to follow the trajectory of inflated expectations surrounding GoPro, which announced on Monday that it will <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/8/16862680/gopro-drones-business-stopped-layoffs-exit\">exit the drone business</a>, laying off hundreds of staff while it attempts to get its finances in order. The re-structuring&#8212;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/5/16854544/gopro-layoffs-karma-drone-sales-2018\">reducing</a> its global-employee head count from 1,254 employees to “fewer than 1,000”&#8212;is expected to cost tens of millions of dollars. In another damning indictment, GoPro has also reportedly hired <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/08/gopro-has-hired-jp-morgan-to-put-itself-up-for-sale.html?__source=sharebar%7Ctwitter&amp;par=sharebar\">JPMorgan Chase</a> to explore a sale; Woodman seemed to confirm the report in an interview on Monday, though he said the company plans to stay independent. “If there are opportunities for us to unite with a bigger parent company to scale GoPro even bigger, that is something that we would look at,” he <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/08/gopro-ceo-nick-woodman-says-the-company-would-entertain-a-sale.html\">told CNBC</a>.</p>\n<p>At the time of its I.P.O., GoPro’s stock traded around $70, a valuation inspired by investors’ faith in the company’s bright future as a content-licensing portal. “Rapid growth and operating-margin expansion should support near-term stock performance, with monetization of content, drones, and virtual reality expanding the total addressable market in future years,” Cowen analyst <strong>Robert Stone</strong> <a href=\"https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/gpro-gopro-expanding-market-for-action-cameras/\">said</a> in a 2015 research report. But re-framing the camera company as a lifestyle platform could not stamp out the fact that at its core, GoPro was a consumer-product company that made one thing really well, and sold it to a niche market of enthusiasts. Woodman himself became an avatar for the overinflated, hype cycle-driven tech boom-turned-bust: he appeared on <em>Shark Tank</em> and was depicted in the <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanmac/2013/03/04/the-mad-billionaire-behind-gopro-the-worlds-hottest-camera-company/#3cf6dc777471\">cockpit of a biplane</a>, every inch the rugged tech entrepreneur. In 2014, he made almost $300 million; for a time, he was the <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2015/04/17/investing/gopro-founder-nick-woodman-highest-paid-ceo-2014/index.html\">highest-paid C.E.O.</a> in America. As of today, he makes a $1 salary as the company he founded attempts to recoup its losses.</p>\n<p>If the cautionary tale of GoPro sounds familiar, it’s because shades of it exist in another much-hyped consumer-tech company. Months after announcing it would pivot to become a “camera company,” Snap, the parent company of Snapchat, went public in a highly anticipated I.P.O. Bulls in the tech press were vocal. “It’s sexier than Facebook,” <em>Inc.</em> <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/sonya-mann/snapchat-bull-case.html\">wrote</a> in May while TechCrunch published <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/17/the-bull-case-for-snapchat/\">a case</a> for Snapchat’s parent company reaching a $100 billion market cap by 2020. Thanks in part to such glowing praise, Snap’s shares closed at $24 on the first day of its I.P.O.&#8212;well above their initial $17 offering price. But the company’s share price has since plummeted, with a series of lackluster earnings reports prompting C.E.O. <strong>Evan Spiegel</strong> to announce an overhaul of the company’s app <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/11/evan-spiegel-announces-snapchat-redesign-amid-brutal-earnings-report\">in November</a>.</p>\n<p>After years of stratospheric growth, Wall Street and Silicon Valley alike appear to be coming back down to earth&#8212;on Monday, GoPro announced that its revenue for the last quarter of 2017 would be about $340 million, its worst holiday financial season since it went public, and an even lower prediction than its original disappointing estimate of $470 million.

What about asking smart media folks what they don&#39;t know about what beckons in 2018? Yes, what about opening the year with a search for a contrition and modesty now always associated with the press? So track down a diverse group of smarties, ask what they&#39;d love to know if they had a crystal ball (and perhaps run to Vegas with the knowledge) and here&#39;s what they say:</p>\n<p><strong>Hamilton Nolan</strong>, senior writer at Splinter and former Gawker stalwart: “I&#39;d like to know how we&#39;re all going to keep having jobs as while Google and Facebook are taking all the ad money.”</p>\n<p><strong>Mike Allen</strong>, Axios co-founder: “Will social platforms truly reward &#8212; with real monetization &#8212; publishers who produce first-class, worthy content without trashy, clunky web pages, annoying pop-up ads and hidden trackers that slow load times?”</p>\n<p><strong>Jon Steinberg</strong>, founder of Cheddar (a partner of <em>Vanity Fair</em>): “When I started Cheddar I never could have foreseen the acceleration of amazing OTT platforms like Sling, DirecTV Now, Philo, Fubo, YouTube TV, Sony Vue, etc. I wonder where we will be in a year. How old will the incumbent cable news audiences get? Which bundles will replace traditional MVPDs. Which Post Cable Networks will take share from incumbents. What will TV in 2018 be?”</p>\n<p><strong>Cenk Uygur</strong>, founder of The Young Turks: “1. How well will the skinny bundles monetize? How many subscribers can they bring in? What percentage of inventory will be filled? What will be the CPMs? What will ‘ratings’ look like? How well will stand alone channels do on platforms like Amazon?”</p>\n<p>“2. Can any digital media company survive on programmatic and branded advertising alone? A corollary to this question is whether advertisers will ever figure out where their under 35 year old customers went (hint: it&#39;s not television)?”</p>\n<p><strong>Lowell Peterson</strong>, executive director of the Writers Guild of America, East: “Will the sexual harassment scandal finally move the entertainment industry past hand-wringing and focus groups on the issue of diversity toward something that will actually make a difference - that is, meaningful progress on diverse hiring and diverse story-telling?  An industry that does not reflect the diversity of our culture, and that consequently permits radical imbalance in representation and power, is not sustainable in the long run.”</p>\n<p><strong>Howard Tullman</strong>, serial entrepreneur and CEO of the leading Chicago start-up hub, 1871: “How soon will regular businesses benefit by the implementation of the blockchain technologies which will eliminate millions of man-hours of wasted time and redundant activities?  Using smart contracts, JP Morgan eliminated 360,000 hours of useless lawyer time reviewing standard contracts already.”</p>\n<p><strong>Jon Margolis</strong>, retired (to Vermont) former chief political writer for the <em>Chicago Tribune</em>: “I would like to know: Will reporters figure out that they should stop tweeting? Of at least tweet a lot less. Reporting and writing a story is a day’s work. It is not necessary (and often gets one in trouble) to waste time and energy venting one’s spleen about whatever.”</p>\n<p><strong>Kathy Kiely</strong>, former longtime Washington reporter-editor now teaching journalism at the University of New Hampshire: “Will news organizations end the self-destructive race for clickbait and take a chance on giving members of the public what they need to know, instead of a steady diet of what they want to know? (Do we dare write about issues instead of Trump&#39;s latest tweet?)”</p>\n<p>“As a corollary, will the public begin to understand that finding the culprit for everything that they hate about the media is as simple as looking in the mirror? Chartbeat tells us all we&#39;d rather not know about your viewing and reading habits. If you want better movies, TV shows, stories, you&#39;re going to have to vote with your clicks. That means changing habits.”</p>\n<p>She also wants to know, “Will the major institutions of civil society&#8212;political, media, educational&#8212;undertake the massive public health campaign its going to take to get all of us to improve our media diets? What we did with tobacco, we&#39;re going to have to do with fake news and other media junk food: identify the threat it poses (in this case to the body politic, not the body), enlighten people about how to make healthier choices and help people who are already addicted. As with tobacco, it will take longer than a year to break the addiction, but will we start the effort?”</p>\n<p><strong>Clay Shirky</strong>, an Internet expert at New York University, wants to know about user-supported media: “2018 is a perfect test-case for user-supported media. By the end of the year, we&#39;ll know if we passed or failed that test.”</p>\n<p>“It&#39;s a very big question. AD-supported media long reigned. Now, newspapers are about to begin their 49th consecutive quarter of year-on-year revenue declines.” Their attempts have failed in essentially saying, “Just like paying for shoes you like, you must pay for news,” conceptualizing it all as a sales transaction, he says.</p>\n<p>“NPR has the right model. People do not regard news as a product, and &#39;pay or else&#39; does not motivate enough of them to subscribe. The message that does work is &#39;You need us, and if you don&#39;t pitch in, we will go away.&#39; &quot;The mindset of the median subscriber is not &#39;I must pay for what I consume,&#39; but &#39;God forbid there not be a New York Times.&#39;”</p>\n<p>In what should be an important election year, “There is clearly no ad-supported alternative for most reporting, and especially local reporting. The obvious alternative is to find a small group of committed citizens in those cities and towns, enough to support the investigative journalism we need.”</p>\n<p>“Most of what&#39;s in a paper has more than adequate substitutes online, from display ads and sports pages to the horoscope and classifieds. The one irreplaceable function&#8212;actual journalism&#8212;has to be supported by the people who need it. 2018 will tell us if there are enough people who care enough to keep that journalism alive.”</p>\n<div class=\"embed cneembed\"><div class=\"embed block cneembed\" data-url=\"//player.cnevids.com/script/video/5a06043c148bb04bf7000022.js?autoplay=1&amp;muted=1\"></div></div><p><strong>Kotb to replace Lauer</strong></p>\n<p>A Cleveland TV critic had contended that &quot;NBC would probably be loathe&quot; to break up the duo of <strong>Hoda Kotb</strong> and <strong>Kathie Lee Gifford</strong> on the 10 a.m hour of <em>Today</em>. Ah, well, not quite so loathe, as it picked her to replace <strong>Matt Lauer</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>First Alabama gave us Roy Moore, now...</strong></p>\n<p><em>The Anniston Star</em> <a href=\"https://www.annistonstar.com/free/star-s-former-publisher-accused-of-assaulting-reporters-in-s/article_097db56a-ef17-11e7-ac32-a7243e990784.html#pq=47m2tU\">reports</a>, &quot;A former Anniston Star reporter says that <strong>H. Brandt Ayers</strong>, chairman of the company that publishes the paper, sexually assaulted her in the 1970s in The Star’s newsroom. <strong>Veronica Pike Kennedy</strong> says Ayers, then the newspaper’s publisher, spanked her against her will in an incident on a Saturday, when Ayers and Kennedy were among the few workers in the building.&quot;</p>\n<p>“&#39;I was still determined to be a reporter after that,&#39; Kennedy said. &#39;But I hated Brandy Ayers with every cell in my body.&#39;”</p>\n<p>&quot;In response to inquiries from The Star on Monday morning, Ayers issued a statement.</p>\n<p>&#39;As a very young man with more authority than judgment, I did some things I regret,&#39; Ayers said in the statement. &#39;At my advanced age I wish I could relive those days again, knowing the seriousness of my position and with the accumulated judgment that goes with age.&#39;”</p>\n<p>&quot;Two other women who worked at The Star at the time told similar stories of spankings by the Star publisher, though each declined to have their names published, citing repercussions the revelations might have for their careers and family members.&quot;</p>\n<p>It just so happens that Ayers wrote an Oct. 29 <a href=\"https://www.annistonstar.com/columnists/h_brandt_ayers/h-brandt-ayers-roy-moore-will-shame-alabama/article_ab4eead2-bb67-11e7-9d92-bb3986757312.html\">op-ed</a> in the paper on Roy Moore. It opened, &quot;There is one certain outcome of the Alabama Senate race if Roy Moore is elected. He will be compelled to embarrass Alabama because of a set of personal religious beliefs that, in his mind, are superior to all man-made institutions, even the Constitution as interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court.&quot;</p>\n<p>And that was a few days before The Washington Post broke news of sexual assault allegations against Moore.</p>\n<p><strong>New boss, same values</strong></p>\n<p>In his first formal day on the job, New York Times Publisher A. G.

Misinformation is rising and trust in the media is declining as technology platforms elevate clickbait, rumor and propaganda over real journalism, and politicians jockey for advantage by inflaming suspicion of the press. Growing polarization is jeopardizing even the foundational assumption of common truths, the stuff that binds a society together.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Like our predecessors at The Times, my colleagues and I will not give in to these forces.&quot;</p>\n<p><strong>The morning Babel</strong></p>\n<p><em>Trump &amp; Friends</em> went heavy with Iran protests as co-hosts waxed ebullient at the start of its new year, even repeating <strong>Mike Pence</strong> (not Trump) tweets.  &quot;You kinda gotta walk the line a bit and show support (for the protesters),&quot; said co-host <strong>Brian Kilmeade</strong>  as he and colleagues got around to blaming <strong>Barack Obama</strong> for most of this via the Obama sanctions deal they don&#39;t like.</p>\n<p>CNN&#39;s <em>New Day</em> assessed Trump&#39;s own initial New Year tweets on Iran and Pakistan, with The New York Times&#39; <strong>David Sanger</strong> also talking about the fine line between supporting Iran protests and not appearing to be the ones fomenting unrest, &quot;the hardest one for the president to navigate.&quot; He then noted that this U.S. government has been &quot;rather selective&quot; in speaking up against human rights, with Trump not doing much ago about what&#39;s up in China and the Philippines, among others.</p>\n<p>MSNBC&#39;s <em>Morning Joe</em> mulled Iran and Pakistan, too, with the latter accused by Trump of lies and deceit. So since the Obama administration withheld aid from Pakistan, what does Trump do? <strong>Richard Haass</strong> noted how Pakistan still provides cover for the Taliban and that making our continuing assistance a big public issue just complicates an inherently messy situation. Still, all the similar discussions provided a brief geopolitical relief before the inevitable immersion into Trump and congressional politics.</p>\n<p><strong>Nate Silver&#39;s holiday ennui</strong></p>\n<p>He tweeted, &quot;A lot of the problem with these mainstream media retrospectives on Trump&#39;s first year is a failure to recognize how profoundly unpopular he is&#8212;especially for a president in a pretty good economy.&quot;</p>\n<p><strong>Holiday feasts</strong></p>\n<p>Reads of the holiday weekend included The New York Times irresistible annual Sunday magazine compilation of essays on interesting people who passed away in the previous year (&quot;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/28/magazine/the-lives-they-lived-mary-tyler-moore.html\">The Lives They Lived</a>&quot;). This group included <strong>Mary Tyler Moore</strong>, a fascinating rehabilitation-medicine specialist, a great photographer, a wonderful poet, a hurricane victim on Puerto Rico, a county music artist, a young Princeton philosopher, and a Native-American artist, among many others. It&#39;s a homage to creativity and human diversity.</p>\n<p>But there was also <strong>Evan Osnos&#39;</strong> <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/01/08/making-china-great-again\">Making China Great Again</a> in <em>The New Yorker</em>, underscoring the perils of Trump foreign policy, naivite and outright ignorance. One Chinese academic calls Trump America&#39;s <strong>Mikhail Gorbachev</strong>, meaning a world leader taking his empire to collapse, at least in the Chinese mind. Then there&#39;s this de facto conclusion via another Chinese adademic, as summarized by Osnos:</p>\n<p>&quot;In both countries, people who are infuriated by profound gaps in wealth and opportunity have pinned their hopes on nationalist, nostalgic leaders, who encourage them to visualize threats from the outside world. &#39;China, Russia, and the U.S. are moving in the same direction,/ he said. &#39;They’re all trying to be great again.&#39;&quot;</p>\n<p><strong>Jeff Kittay tries to again break the mold</strong></p>\n<p>Former Yale professor <strong>Jeff Kittay</strong> produced one of the 1990s best, small circulation magazines. It was called Lingua Franca and explored the academic world in a wonderfully alluring, accessible and nervy way. Now he&#39;s turned to the world of food.</p>\n<p>But he&#39;s not focusing on reviews of restaurants and profiles of popular chiefs. Nor is he going down the second major route, namely niche reporting for producers on how they might be more efficient and profitable. Instead, he&#39;s looking at a changing food economy and how it impacts our lives and American culture. It&#39;s called the New Food Economy and <a href=\"https://www.poynter.org/news/he-created-legendary-academic-journal-so-can-jeff-kittay-do-same-food\">very much worth a look</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>A heyday for investigative reporting?</strong></p>\n<p>There is lots of fabulous work being done these days, some of it by new digital news operations. Here&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2017/12/28/dr-phil-addiction/\">one effort</a> by STAT and the <em>Boston Globe</em> over the holiday weekend that hammers <strong>Phillip McGraw</strong>, better known as &quot;Dr. Phil,&quot; for placing guests he purports to help in substantial,ratings-driven risk.</p>\n<p>For sure, there&#39;s a certain conventional wisdom about an improvement in investigative reporting, with Politico even finding <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/12/31/trump-better-things-president-effects-216201\">a cause and effect due</a> to the coming of Donald Trump as president. It might be smart for those claiming same to hop in a car and drive ti mid-sized and smaller media markets outside Washington and New York.  A new business model is unclear and the notion of improving investigative labors is dubious.</p>\n<p>A tiny example: A few years ago there were more than 30 full-time reporters covering the Illinois legislature. If you didn&#39;t know, no state&#39;s financial are more messed up than Illinois, and no state could use more diligent reporting of a legislature ruled by Democrats (largely one power broker named <strong>Michael Madigan</strong>).</p>\n<p>According to <strong>Madeleine Doubek</strong>, a longtime Illinois political reporter who is now Policy &amp; Civic Engagement Director at Chicago&#39;s Better Government Association, that number is now down to four:  The Associated Press (<strong>John O’Connor</strong>), the Chicago Tribune (<strong>Monique Garcia</strong>), the State Journal-Register/Gatehouse (<strong>Doug Finkle</strong>) and Capitol Fax (<strong>Rich Miller</strong>).</p>\n<p>ProPublica has expanded its Illinois operation and already done a nice job on tax assessments in Cook County. But that probably won&#39;t fill the gaping hole in the capital or, as telling, the sharp decline in systematic coverage of an array of government and other beats with newsroom declines. It all amounts to a big asterisk on claims of Trump and any journalism renaissance.</p>\n<p><strong>Big and unceremonious exit in Nashville</strong></p>\n<p>How it communicates bad news is revealing of an organization.  At Nashville&#39;s WSMV-TV in Nashville, longtime local TV star <strong>Demetria Kalodimos</strong>  <a href=\"https://www.nashvillescene.com/news/pith-in-the-wind/article/20987234/demetria-kalodimos-out-at-wsmv\">says</a> her exit after more than 30 years as an anchor &quot;came with a letter left on a desk, no conversation, no face to face meeting, no thanks. I have spent more than half of my life at WSMV, working long and unpredictable hours, winning awards and ratings, serving and understanding the community and building trust. It is quite sad to end a nearly 34 year career the way this company chose to end it, with a letter left on a desk, no conversation, no face to face meeting, no thanks.&quot;</p>\n<p>Poynter&#39;s <strong>Al Tompkins</strong> says, &quot;I would remind viewers that she is the only local anchor in the country that I know who is/was deeply involved in serious investigative reporting significant enough to be honored by the Investigative Reporters and Editors with two medals. It is among the highest honors in journalism on par with DuPont, Peabody and Pulitzers.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;More than 25 years ago, she was involved in investigating contaminated blood clotting factor that nearly wiped out a generation of hemophiliacs. She uncovered what was known as The Body Farm near Knoxville, a place where a researcher gathered up unclaimed human bodies, some of them homeless people, some were veterans who nobody claimed. And the researcher set those bodies outside to study how they decayed, essentially rotted, as part of his forensic science. Families of the dead had no idea.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;She uncovered the horrific living conditions that migrant workers were enduring in rural Tennessee. She investigated toxic waste and overweight trucks. She investigated plagiarism in country music lyrics (oh boy did that light some fuses in Nashville.)&quot;</p>\n<p><strong>Too much or too little regulation?</strong></p>\n<p><em>The New York Times</em> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/27/business/picking-apples-on-a-farm-with-5000-rules-watch-out-for-the-ladders.html?_r=0\">profiled an upstate New York apple farm</a> that must heed thousands of government regulations, with the strong implication that things have gone too far  (one can imagine how this tale by the &quot;Fake News, money-losing&quot; Times will make the rounds of de-regulation-minded Trump allies). That may be so for some in produce. But read <em>Bloomberg Businessweek</em> on <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-12-29/america-s-worst-graveyard-shift-is-grinding-up-workers\">the obvious exploitation of immigrants</a> when it comes to low-wage, dangerous night jobs cleaning up slaughterhouses, where &quot;the nightly storm of high-­pressure hoses, chemical vapors, blood, grease, and frantic deadlines, all swirling in clouds of steam around pulsing belts, blades, and blenders, can be treacherous.&quot;</p>\n<p><strong>&quot;Black Monday&quot;</strong></p>\n<p>There was wall-to-wall coverage on sports cable channels, notably the NFL Network, as the tradition of canning NFL coaches as soon as the regular season ended played out again. Once again, big players, including ESPN&#39;s <strong>Adam Shefter</strong> scooped some local reporters on their hometown coach being gone.

It had gathered for the Berggruen Institute gala, where British “citizen philosopher” <strong>Baroness Onora O’Neill</strong> was being honored with a $1 million prize given to a person “whose ideas have helped us find direction, wisdom, and  improved self-understanding in a world being rapidly transformed by profound social, technological, political, cultural, and economic change.” Other guests included <strong>Jeff Koons,</strong> Snapchat C.E.O. <strong>Evan Spiegel,</strong> <strong>Princess Firyal of Jordan,</strong> former prime minister of Spain <strong>Felipe González,</strong> <strong>Wendi Deng,</strong> and <strong>Tyler Winklevoss.</strong></p>\n<p>The main topics of the night were two of the issues O’Neill specializes in: technology and ethics, and how much we can trust those who create technology.</p>\n<p>“Technology alone without ethics is like fire,” said Nicolas Berggruen, the philanthropist and investor behind the Berggruen Institute. “Fire can be good. It can save you, but it can burn you. You can’t have technology without having an ethical discussion.”</p>\n<p>Koons, who recently worked on an augmented reality project with Snapchat, had a similar sentiment: “You can pick up a stone and use it as a tool that can help you make a garment, or you can use it as a weapon, and so it’s always been in human in history, but it’s important that we embrace technologies, but we always have to remember our moral character, we always have to recognize that.”</p>\n<p>Spiegel, for his part, refused to comment.  “I have nothing interesting to say,” he quipped.</p>\n<p>After cocktail hour, guests headed into the Celeste Bartos Forum for dinner. Koons chatted with Spiegel, while Deng and Winklevoss were spotted in conversation. After everyone took their seats, Berggruen Institute president Craig Calhoun welcomed the guests as they began to dine on a root-vegetable tart.</p>\n<p>While the guests enjoyed pressed chicken breast or black sea bass, journalist Fareed Zakaria interviewed O’Neill about her work before Berggruen Prize jury chair  __Kwame Anthony Appiah __ handed O’Neill the trophy, an illuminated sculpture by Chinese artist Cai Guo-Qiang.</p>\n<p>“Is being human more about those emotional and social qualities? Is that maybe a return to a past where from all histories of humans and life&#8212;all universities and life, where newspapers and magazines . . .  have had a very short existence&#8212;humans were more social, they were emotional, they were physical. Are we returning to that?” asked Zakaria.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think we are,” said O’Neill. “I think we probably should.”</p>","channel":"Style","subChannel":"Parties","tags":["arianna huffington","even

Holmes and Jamie Foxx at Pre-Grammys Gala","body":"<p>There are not many dinner events where you can watch <strong>Martha Stewart</strong> glide by <strong>Lil Uzi Vert</strong> or see <strong>Pink</strong> squeeze past <strong>Robert Kraft</strong>&#8212;but such is the nature of <strong>Clive Davis’s</strong> annual pre-Grammys gala event. The Grammys are being held in New York City this year for the first time since 2003. And Davis&#8212;a legendary producer and executive, who has made this event (always held the night before the Grammys) into an integral part of the weekend&#8212;said several times over the course of Saturday night’s gala, held at the Sheraton New York Times Square, that he was aiming to construct an evening that truly honored and celebrated “New York.”</p>\n<p>The guest of honor was about as New York as a guest of honor can be: <strong>Jay-Z,</strong> who received the Salute to Industry Icons Award. Accompanied by wife <strong>Beyoncé,</strong> the two entered the ballroom shortly before the dinner portion of the evening had concluded. Followed by handlers (who batted away anyone trying to take a covert cell phone picture of the couple), they were greeted by a number of friends before sitting at their table. (Beyoncé&#8212;whom Davis later referred to as “the First Lady of music”&#8212;wore a striking black beret to the event, making her particularly easy to spot.) A Chainsmoker or two mingled with <strong>Rita Ora</strong> and <strong>Shawn Mendes,</strong> as <strong>Lorde</strong> (in a shimmering metallic dress) snaked by them. <strong>John Oliver</strong> made way past <strong>Jerry</strong> and <strong>Jessica Seinfeld,</strong> as <strong>John Legend</strong> led wife <strong>Chrissy Teigen</strong> to their table. (Pink, a table nearby, agreed to a fan’s request for a photo as she remained seated at her table.) <strong>Nick Jonas</strong> and <strong>Ray Romano,</strong> not two people anyone has likely ever associated with one another, were standing in adjacent groups outside the ballroom.</p>\n<p>The night was distinguished by its top-notch performances&#8212;<strong>Barry Manilow,</strong> who kicked things off and was followed by “Despacito” crooner <strong>Luis Fonsi</strong> (<strong>Justin Bieber</strong>  was nowhere in sight); rap trio Migos; Broadway’s <strong>Ben Platt</strong> and <strong>Leslie Odom Jr.,</strong> who performed their hits from <em>Dear Evan Hansen</em> and <em>Hamilton,</em> respectively; <strong>Gladys Knight,</strong> who garnered perhaps the most excitement from the crowd; <strong>Alicia Keys,</strong> who performed a special Jay-Z tribute; up-and-comers <strong>Khalid</strong> and <strong>Logic</strong> (Davis compared discovering Khalid at this stage in his career to working with Whitney Houston at a similar moment in hers); and finally an <strong>Aretha Franklin</strong> tribute from <strong>Jennifer Hudson,</strong> whom Davis said he believes is the heir apparent to Franklin.</p>\n<p>Keys’s performance generated the most buzz, as the singer, stationed at a piano, paid tribute to Jay-Z&#8212;her collaborator on “Empire State of Mind,” of course&#8212;with a spirited medley of Jay-Z classics (from “Hard Knock Life” to “Encore” to “Run This Town”), and, upon accepting the statue, Jay seemed profoundly moved by Keys’s performance. He also candidly discussed his fraught dynamic with the Grammys, explaining he boycotted the ceremony for several years starting in 1998 after <strong>DMX</strong> was snubbed by the Academy. He only returned, in 2004, when Beyoncé was up for major nominations. “I didn’t come back until 2004 when a beautiful young lady whom I love dearly had a solo album,” he said. (There were no shout-outs to&#8212;or, sadly, anecdotes about&#8212;children <strong>Blue Ivy, Rumi,</strong> or <strong>Sir</strong> in the speech.)</p>\n<p>Davis, 85, explained to the audience at the night’s beginning that he has always found it irritating to have to wait while the set changes between performances at an event with multiple acts. His solution? While the stagehands would switch out the equipment on stage, Davis would introduce various members of the audience to everyone in the crowd. When a particular celebrity’s name was called (following a brief Davis introduction), the cameras would zoom in on that celebrity. Davis shouted out everyone from <strong>Nancy Pelosi</strong> (“She loves music”) to <strong>Hoda Kotb</strong> to <strong>Ludacris</strong> to <strong>Les Moonves</strong> to <strong>Tina Fey</strong> to <strong>Howard Schultz</strong> to <strong>Chris Bosh</strong> to <strong>Andrew Lloyd Webber</strong> over the course of the night. Most, like <strong>Diddy</strong> or <strong>Kathie Lee Gifford,</strong> would stand and wave, acknowledging Davis’s kind words; others, like__Cardi B,__ for example, just waved and remained seated.</p>\n<p>And in one case, Davis inadvertently created some gossipy buzz: he started to introduce <strong>Katie Holmes,</strong> noting that he had <em>wanted</em> to introduce her earlier in the evening, presumably when he had been introducing her <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/03/katie-holmes-jamie-foxx-holding-hands-photo\">long-rumored</a> but never quite official boyfriend, <strong>Jamie Foxx,</strong> but she “had stepped out for two minutes.” He added, “She’s sitting with Jamie.” But when the camera moved in on where she was supposed to be seated, only Jamie was visible on the overhead screen. Eventually the cameras found Holmes, who had moved to sit at a different table, one away from Foxx (photographs show that the famously private pair had been sitting together earlier, and reconvened at the same table later). Holmes’s face, as Davis discussed her and the camera remained fixed on her, was one of supreme discomfort. Davis assessed, referencing their often coy behavior, “If you’re going to sit together, what better night than tonight.” When all the guests spilled out of the ballroom at about midnight, Foxx was surrounded by a group of friends, but Holmes was nowhere in sight.</p>","channel":"Style","subChannel":"Celebrity","tags":["Beyonce","Jay Z","Clive Davis"],"ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"dek":"The star-studded event drew an eclectic crowd of music, television, and sports stars.","seoTitle":"Clive Davis Puts the Spotlight on a Coy Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx at Pre-Grammys Gala","seoDescription":"The star-studded event drew an eclectic crowd of music, television, and sports stars.","socialTitle":"Clive Davis Puts the Spotlight on a Coy Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx at Pre-Grammys Gala","socialDescription":"The star-studded event drew an eclectic crowd of music, television, and sports stars.","issueDate":"","rubric":"On The Scene","promoHed":"Clive Davis Puts the Spotlight on a Coy Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx at Pre-Grammys Gala","promoDek":"The star-studded event drew an eclectic crowd of music, television, and sports stars.","id":"5a6e084fcfe5381e81f98f5f","revision":18,"createdAt":"January 28, 2018 12:28 pm","modifiedAt":"January 28, 2018 7:16 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"January 28, 2018 7:16 pm","_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Josh Duboff","filename":"jamie-foxx-katie-holmes.jpg","aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1440,"height":965,"format":"JPEG","duration":null,"url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2018/01/28/5a6e13aff7749464647f972e_jamie-foxx-katie-holmes.jpg"},"3:2":{"override":false,"height":960,"width":1440,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":960,"width":1440,"x":0,"y":0}},"duration":null},"5:3":{"override":false,"height":864,"width":1440,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":864,"width":1440,"x":0,"y":0}},"duration":null},"2:3":{"override":false,"height":963,"width":642,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":963,"width":642,"x":399,"y":0}},"duration":null},"9:16":{"override":false,"height":960,"width":540,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":960,"width":540,"x":450,"y":0}},"duration":null},"7:3":{"override":false,"height":615,"width":1435,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":615,"width":1435,"x":2.5,"y":0}},"duration":null},"16:9":{"override":false,"height":810,"width":1440,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":810,"width":1440,"x":0,"y":0}},"duration":null},"4:3":{"override":false,"height":963,"width":1284,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":963,"width":1284,"x":78,"y":0}},"duration":null},"1:1":{"override":false,"height":965,"width":965,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":965,"width":965,"x":237.5,"y":0}},"duration":null}},"title":"jamie-foxx-katie-holmes.jpg","description":"911230414","caption":"","credit":"by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for NARAS","cropMode":"TOP","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":true,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":false},"restrictCropping":false,"id":"5a6e13aff7749464647f972f","revision":1,"createdAt":"January 28, 2018 1:17 pm","modifiedAt":"January 28, 2018 1:17 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"January 28, 2018 1:17 pm","tags":[],"altText":"","modelName":"photo","collection":"photos"}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"name":"Josh Duboff","id":"53d70c86c980f8de611b70b1","revision":16,"createdAt":"July 28, 2014 10:52 pm","modifiedAt":"May 27, 2016 8:03 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 27, 2016 8:03 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"contributors","modelName":"contributor","publishable":true,"image":false,"identifiable":true,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":false},"bio":"Josh Duboff is a VF.com senior writer, based in New York, who covers entertainment and culture.

Unlike Facebook or Twitter, which found their platforms manipulated during the 2016 election, Snapchat isn’t really a social network: the ephemeral photo- and video-messaging service isn’t set up to allow information to go viral. Its “Discover” platform, where users can watch slickly produced video clips, relies on collaborations with trusted and vetted news outlets. The potential for “fake news,” which has plagued other tech platforms, is strictly limited. It’s a huge advantage at a time when Silicon Valley is under fire. And it’s one that C.E.O. <strong>Evan Spiegel</strong> was more than happy to tout in an op-ed <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/how-snapchat-is-separating-social-from-media-2513315946.html\">for Axios</a> on Wednesday, even as his company <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/11/evan-spiegel-announces-snapchat-redesign-amid-brutal-earnings-report\">struggles</a> to win over investors in the public market.</p>\n<p>“Social media fueled ‘fake news’ because content designed to be shared by friends is not necessarily content designed to deliver accurate information,” Spiegel wrote. Snapchat’s algorithms are superior, he argued, because they’re “based on <em>your</em> interests&#8212;not on the interests of ‘friends’&#8212;and to make sure media companies also profit off the content they produce for our Discover platform. We think this helps guard against fake news and mindless scrambles for friends or unworthy distractions.”</p>\n<p>In fact, if it were up to him, Snapchat wouldn’t be categorized as a social-media platform at all. “While many people view Snapchat as a social media service, it is primarily used to talk with friends&#8212;like visual texting,” Spiegel said. “Snapchat began as an escape from social media, where people could send photos and videos to their friends without the pressure of likes, comments, and permanence.”</p>\n<p>Ironically, Spiegel’s solution to “fake news” necessitates dialing back the clock to a time before social media altogether. The model described recalls that of a broadcast network: unidirectional, with vetted sources and publishers, providing news without commentary or a sharing function. But there are marked limitations to that approach: if the content viewers see is finite and comes from a pre-selected list of partners, and if users aren’t able to seek out news on their own outside the confines of the app, Snapchat could arguably have its own filter-bubble problem. Facebook, on the other hand, is seen as the anti-broadcast: an egalitarian platform where users decide what floats to the top. While that means that Facebook as a platform is easier to abuse, it has also made <strong>Mark Zuckerberg’s</strong> company immensely <a href=\"https://www.recode.net/2017/5/4/15542094/facebook-twitter-profit-loss-ipo-chart\">more profitable</a> per user.</p>\n<p>Snapchat, meanwhile, has struggled to flourish on the public market, and the timing of Spiegel’s article is not coincidental: on Wednesday, Snapchat announced the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/29/16712704/snapchat-redesign-friend-feed-discover?utm_campaign=theverge&amp;utm_content=chorus&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter\">specifics</a> of a redesign of its app, which Spiegel hopes will reverse a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/11/evan-spiegel-announces-snapchat-redesign-amid-brutal-earnings-report\">plummeting stock price</a> and satiate investor expectations. The new app, Spiegel said, is better for users than a social-media platform, and is intended to separate the “social” aspect of the platform (communicating with friends) from “media” (the news-consuming Discovery feature). “The combination of social and media has yielded incredible business results, but has ultimately undermined our relationships with our friends and our relationships with the media,” Spiegel explained. “We believe that the best path forward is disentangling the two by providing a personalized content feed based on what you want to watch, not what your friends post.”</p>\n<p>On Discover, algorithms and machine learning will personalize stories for users based on their viewing habits alone, rather than their friends’ behavior. More than 80 media partners will produce exclusive content for the platform, but humans will still curate the news that appears on Snapchat in the first place, Spiegel said, which could exacerbate its filter-bubble issue. Spiegel argued that Discover’s model will yield premium content. “We think this helps guard against fake news and mindless scrambles for friends or unworthy distractions,” he said, but it’s a bit disingenuous: Snapchat has repeatedly come under fire for the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017/01/23/snapchat-fights-discover-clickbait/\">salacious, clickbait-y headlines</a> in Discover, which it tried to eliminate earlier this year.</p>\n<p>It isn’t much of a reach to interpret Spiegel’s musings&#8212;and, by extension, Snapchat’s entire redesign&#8212;as a shot at Facebook, which has been shamelessly copying Snapchat’s features over the past year, integrating Stories into each of its stand-alone apps and adding in functionalities like face filters and messaging streaks that mimic Snapchat’s own. But what makes Snap truly unique, albeit less profitable, may ultimately prove the basis for a more stable product in the long run. Snapchat’s model, which is inherently more private than Facebook’s, has historically de-emphasized community&#8212;at a time in which online communities are growing increasingly toxic and divisive, it could benefit Snapchat to position itself as the “escape” Spiegel described, and which so many, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/11/the-end-of-the-social-era-twitter-facebook-snapchat\">according</a> to my colleague <strong>Nick Bilton,</strong> actively crave.</p>","channel":"News","subChannel":"Tech","tags":["snapchat","social-media","evan spiegel","facebook","friend"],"ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"dek":"With its stock price in free fall and an app overhaul underway, will separating “social” from ”media” be enough to save Snapchat?","seoTitle":"Why Snapchat’s Greatest Advantage Could Be Its Fatal Flaw","seoDescription":"With its stock price in free fall and an app overhaul underway, will separating “social” from ”media” be enough to save Snapchat?","socialTitle":"Why Snapchat’s Greatest Advantage Could Be Its Fatal Flaw","socialDescription":"With its stock price in free fall and an app overhaul underway, will separating “social” from ”media” be enough to save Snapchat?","issueDate":"","rubric":"Snapchat","promoHed":"Why Snapchat’s Greatest Advantage Could Be Its Fatal Flaw","promoDek":"With its stock price in free fall and an app overhaul underway, will separating “social” from ”media” be enough to save Snapchat?","id":"5a1ee3f2fb9c553c41e259ce","revision":6,"createdAt":"November 29, 2017 11:44 am","modifiedAt":"November 29, 2017 12:09 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"November 29, 2017 12:09 pm","_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Maya Kosoff","filename":"Evan-Spiegel-Snapchat-FB.jpg","aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1544,"height":1029,"format":"JPEG","duration":null,"url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2017/11/29/5a1ee482b8083535e8a9c87d_Evan-Spiegel-Snapchat-FB.jpg"},"3:2":{"override":false,"height":1028,"width":1542,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1028,"width":1542,"x":1,"y":0}},"duration":null},"5:3":{"override":false,"height":924,"width":1540,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":924,"width":1540,"x":2,"y":0}},"duration":null},"2:3":{"override":false,"height":1029,"width":686,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1029,"width":686,"x":429,"y":0}},"duration":null},"9:16":{"override":false,"height":1024,"width":576,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1024,"width":576,"x":484,"y":0}},"duration":null},"7:3":{"override":false,"height":660,"width":1540,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":660,"width":1540,"x":2,"y":0}},"duration":null},"16:9":{"override":false,"height":864,"width":1536,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":864,"width":1536,"x":4,"y":0}},"duration":null},"4:3":{"override":false,"height":1029,"width":1372,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1029,"width":1372,"x":86,"y":0}},"duration":null},"1:1":{"override":false,"height":1029,"width":1029,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1029,"width":1029,"x":257.5,"y":0}},"duration":null}},"title":"SNAP IPO","credit":"By Michael Nagle/Bloomberg/Getty Images.","cropMode":"TOP","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":true,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":false},"restrictCropping":false,"id":"5a1ee482b8083535e8a9c87e","revision":1,"createdAt":"November 29, 2017 11:46 am","modifiedAt":"November 29, 2017 11:47 am","revisionCreatedAt":"November 29, 2017 11:47 am","tags":[],"altText":"SNAP IPO","description":"Getty; 647204978","modelName":"photo","collection":"photos"}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Maya Kosoff","name":"Maya Kosoff","bio":"Maya Kosoff writes about tech for VF.com.

href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/01/inside-the-feedback-loop-between-the-president-and-fox-news\">feedback loop</a> between Fox News and <strong>Donald Trump</strong> is no secret: the president regularly starts his mornings with several hours of tweets responding to <em>Fox &amp; Friends,</em> and ends his days with online musings about the latest talking points in primetime. In the span of a year, <strong>Steve Doocy, Brian Kilmeade, Tucker Carlson,</strong> and <strong>Sean Hannity</strong> have become, unexpectedly, some of the most powerful people on the planet. Behind the scenes, however, the relationship is even more symbiotic. As my colleague <strong>Gabriel Sherman</strong> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/01/inside-the-feedback-loop-between-the-president-and-fox-news\">reported</a> last month, Trump has lately evolved into a sort of de facto head of programming at Fox, calling hosts to praise their analysis or to suggest new messaging. “What he usually does is he’ll call after a show and say, ‘I <em>really</em> enjoyed that,’” one former Fox anchor said. “The highest compliment is, ‘I really learned something.’ Then you know he got a new policy idea.”</p>\n<p>That feedback loop has spun faster in recent weeks, as Fox&#8212;and then the White House&#8212;seized on a memo, compiled by staffers of Republican Rep. <strong>Devin Nunes,</strong> that purports to show FISA warrant abuses by the F.B.I. White House aides reportedly worried that the document&#8212;declassified and released to the public on Friday&#8212;<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/02/donald-trump-christopher-wray-nunes-memo\">would be a dud</a>, and according to <em>The Washington Post,</em> Chief of Staff <strong>John Kelly</strong> had cautioned the president that the memo might not live up to the hype. But Hannity, who had called the memo “the biggest political scandal in American history,” was adamant that it be released. And, according to the Daily Beast, he had Trump’s ear:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>According to three sources with knowledge of their conversations, Trump has been in regular contact with Hannity over the phone in recent weeks, as the Fox News primetime star and Trump ally has encouraged the prompt release of a controversial four-page memo crafted by Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee. Hannity has gone to the wall to push for the public release of the memo, which the intelligence panel and its chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA), authorized this week in a party-line vote despite the classified information therein.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sources say Hannity’s persistent advocacy reinforced Trump’s already-growing determination to get that memo into the public realm&#8212;despite huge potential fallout within the law-enforcement and intelligence arms of his own administration.\nIn their conversations, Trump and Hannity discussed the Nunes memo’s supposed bombshell-level significance, and how it could shed light on the alleged anti-Trump bias and “corruption” at the F.B.I. On these calls, Trump has directly referenced specific recent Hannity segments related to #ReleaseTheMemo, according to one of three sources with knowledge of their conversations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In his role as Trump-whisperer, Hannity was part of a larger group of “friends and advisers” who, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/never-any-hesitation-trump-was-quickly-convinced-to-support-memos-release/2018/02/01/b67a0246-076d-11e8-8777-2a059f168dd2_story.html\">according</a> to the <em>Post,</em> convinced the president&#8212;in spite of warnings from Democratic lawmakers and intelligence agencies&#8212;that the document had to be published. “There was never any hesitation,” one presidential adviser said. “The president was resolved on this. He was not going to be persuaded [otherwise]. He wanted it out.” The fact that Hannity had predicted the memo would “shock the conscience,” and that its revelations would make “Watergate [look] like stealing a Snickers bar from a drugstore,” appeared to have more currency than Kelly’s notes of caution.</p>\n<p>Trump got his wish on Friday afternoon, when the unredacted document was published on the House Intelligence Committee’s Web site, despite an F.B.I. statement citing “grave concerns” as to its accuracy. A cursory analysis of the document revealed it to be more or less <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/02/donald-trump-christopher-wray-nunes-memo\">a nothingburger</a>, containing no significant new details and certainly nothing to warrant “jail time.” Hannity, however, was ecstatic, calling the document <a href=\"https://www.hannity.com/media-room/the-smoking-gun-memo-shows-russia-dossier-used-to-surveil-trump-campaign/\">“explosive”</a> on his Web site, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/seanhannity/status/959491663893794817\">tweeting</a> that it represented “an unprecedented Government abuse of power,” and promising followers that he would discuss it <a href=\"https://twitter.com/seanhannity/status/959484893582561281\">“at length”</a> on his radio show.</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/seanhannity/status/959491663893794817\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/seanhannity/status/959491663893794817\">https://twitter.com/seanhannity/status/959491663893794817</a></p></blockquote></div><p>Within the Trump-Hannity feedback loop, Hannity’s power in Washington may have increased at Trump’s expense. One senior adviser <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/sean-hannity-has-been-advising-donald-trump-on-the-nunes-memo-because-of-course-he-has\">joked</a> to the Daily Beast that Hannity has essentially become a “senior counselor to the president.” But Hannity’s political calculus and incentives differ from those of the White House, which <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/02/donald-trump-christopher-wray-nunes-memo\">must now contend with</a> a compromised relationship with the intelligence community, not to mention the increased scrutiny of special counsel <strong>Robert Mueller.</strong> Hannity closed the circle, but he may also have done irreparable harm to its most crucial link.</p>\n<div class=\"embed

“Banal” to Sue","body":"<p><strong>Taylor Swift</strong> has gotten out of a lawsuit because her lyrics are not creative enough. Or that’s how she got in the lawsuit in the first place. The two writers for 3LW’s seminal 2001 song, “Playas Gon’ Play,” <strong>Sean Hall</strong> and <strong>Nathan Butler,</strong> <a href=\"http://variety.com/2018/music/news/taylor-swift-player-hater-dismiss-1202697663/\">claimed copyright infringement</a> over the use of the phrase, “The players gonna play, play, play, and the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate,” in her 2014 manifesto, “Shake It Off.”</p>\n<p>Per the Copyright Act, a song is protected if the music or lyrics are more than what the court deems “the banal or trivial.” Phrases and cliches tend not to fall under its protection, as they tend to lack the creativity required. Ipso facto ergo, “players gonna play, and haters gonna hate” is fair use, as U.S. District Judge <strong>Michael W. Fitzgerald</strong> of California has ruled. “The concept of actors acting in accordance with their essential nature is not at all creative; it is banal,” he wrote. “In the early 2000s, popular culture was adequately suffused with the concepts of players and haters to render the phrases ‘playas . . . gonna play’ or ‘haters . . . gonna hate,’ standing on their own, no more creative than ‘runners gonna run,’ ‘drummers gonna drum,’ or ‘swimmers gonna swim.’”</p>\n<p>The songwriters will have a chance to amend the complaint, but their lawyer <strong>Gerard Fox,</strong> the attorney for the two songwriters, said he will instead appeal the ruling to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Fox told <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/14/taylor-swift-shakes-off-copyright-lawsuit-over-hit-song.html\">CNBC</a>, “[Judge Fitzgerald] cannot make himself an expert in the music industry. I’m sorry, it’s actually embarrassing.”</p>\n<p>The lawsuit itself isn’t that creative, either. Somebody already tried to sue Swift for the same lyrics. A man named <strong><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2015/11/12/us/taylor-swift-copyright-lawsuit-dismissed/index.html\">Jessie Braham</a></strong> sought $42 million in damages in federal court in 2015, alleging copyright infringement of his 2013 single “Haters Gone Hate,” which he recorded as Jesse Graham and is still available for a listen  on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=808MLaHcBs4\">YouTube</a>. He claimed that she wouldn’t have written the song if not for his song published a year earlier. This is unlikely, and U.S. District Court Judge <strong>Gail Standish</strong> agreed. <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/11/taylor-swift-lyrics-lawsuit-judge-gail-standish\">She even got cute with her ruling</a>: “At present, the Court is not saying that Braham can never, ever, ever get his case back in court. But, for now, we have got problems, and the Court is not sure Braham can solve them. . . . And, upon consideration of the Court&#39;s explanation . . . Braham may discover that mere pleading Band-Aids will not fix the bullet holes in his case. At least for the moment, Defendants have shaken off this lawsuit.” Finally, some creativity.</p>","channel":"Style","subChannel":"Celebrity","tags":["taylor swift","jessie braham","vanities","Sean

the Latest Mueller Bombshell","body":"<p>For the third of Americans who have stood resolutely by <strong>Donald Trump</strong> through revelations about his son’s <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2018/01/03/bannon-trump-jr-meeting-with-russians-was-treasonous/\">“treasonous”</a> colloquies with Russian agents, <strong>George Papadopoulos’s</strong> adventures in Europe, and <strong>Michael Flynn’s</strong> plea deal, the news that the president had attempted to fire <strong>Robert Mueller</strong> last summer did little to shake their faith. Still, the episode provoked the usual cognitive dissonance among Republicans, populists, MAGA-heads, and other self-styled deplorables. Perhaps nothing better encapsulated the latest twist in Mueller-gate than <strong>Sean Hannity’s</strong> reaction on Thursday night, when he spent the majority of his live show bashing the report, naturally, as fake news. “At this hour, <em>The New York Times</em> is trying to distract you,” he railed, alleging that he had personally checked in with his own sources and that they had denied the story. Minutes later, however, his Fox News colleague <strong>Ed Henry</strong> <a href=\"https://www.mediaite.com/tv/sean-hannitys-reaction-to-fox-news-confirming-the-nyt-mueller-report-is-absolutely-priceless/\">confirmed the story’s basic facts</a>, and Hannity’s pivot shall live forever in cable-news infamy.</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/MEPFuller/status/956729170700259329\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MEPFuller/status/956729170700259329\">https://twitter.com/MEPFuller/status/956729170700259329</a></p></blockquote></div><p>It was Hannity’s perverse defense of his flip-flop, however, that truly set the tone for the far-right in its approach to the <em>Times</em> bombshell. “I will NEVER EVER EVER run with @nytimes anonymous sources,” Hannity <a href=\"https://twitter.com/seanhannity/status/956753946164391936\">tweeted</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/seanhannity/status/956751895523020800\">blasted</a> the “liberal sheep” who thought he should. Journalists on Twitter sniggered, but the MAGA machine followed suit, adopting an ever-evolving variant of the Hannity logic: the <em>Times</em> story is false. Well, not entirely. But if there are elements that are true, it’s old news. And if not, people should stop freaking out anyway. The president can do whatever he wants. Besides, look at <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/26/us/politics/hillary-clinton-chose-to-shield-a-top-adviser-accused-of-harassment-in-2008.html\">this story</a> about <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> keeping an accused sexual harasser on her 2008 campaign staff. But that other <em>Times</em> story? It’s a witch hunt.</p>\n<p>That argumentative knot manifested itself in different ways. While CNN and MSNBC spent a substantial portion of the ensuing 12 hours period in eye-popping frenzy, Breitbart and the Drudge Report buried the <em>Times</em> story in their sidebars, instead highlighting Trump’s appearance at Davos and his heralding of the “America First” agenda. (By the end of Friday, the Mueller story had disappeared from Drudge’s page entirely, <a href=\"http://www.drudgereportarchives.com/data/2018/01/26/20180126_210754.htm\">replaced with stories</a> about <strong>Eminem</strong> attacking the president, a mass baboon breakout in Paris, and a car-surfing cat.) The Daily Caller expressed its skepticism in another way&#8212;not by directly discounting the <em>Times</em> story, but by running a <a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2018/01/26/source-strzok-hadnt-seen-evidence-of-collusion-after-10-months-on-russia-probe/\">piece about F.B.I agent <strong>Peter Strzok’s</strong> texts expressing doubts about the probe</a>.</p>\n<p>For other right-wing types, the Mueller bombshell was hardly a story at all&#8212;it was, after all, news from last summer. “It’s a seven-month-old story about something the president didn’t do,” <strong>Jack Posobiec,</strong> the controversial pro-Trump activist, told me in a text, pointing out that Newsmax C.E.O. <strong>Chris Ruddy</strong> had outlined the contours of the <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/chris-ruddy-i-was-right-about-trump-wanting-to-fire-mueller\">same story</a> back in June. Back then, the White House had pushed back, saying that Ruddy hadn’t known what the hell he was talking about, and the Trump base had largely ignored the story, primarily because the possibility that Trump might fire Mueller was considered a non-issue. So when the <em>Times</em> reported that Trump had ordered White House Counsel <strong>Don McGahn</strong> to send Mueller packing&#8212;and that McGahn had refused, forcing Trump to back down&#8212;the MAGA faithful yawned:</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/LibertarianBlue/status/956728116449366017\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/LibertarianBlue/status/956728116449366017\">https://twitter.com/LibertarianBlue/status/956728116449366017</a></p></blockquote></div><p>The feedback loop that runs between the White House and <em>Fox &amp; Friends</em> often obscures the origin of Trump talking points. (As my colleague <strong>Gabriel Sherman</strong> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/01/inside-the-feedback-loop-between-the-president-and-fox-news\">reported</a>, Trump has, in a way, become the network’s de facto chief programmer.) But on Friday, with Trump six hours ahead on Davos, Switzerland, time, it was clearly the president who took the lead. By the time <em>Fox &amp; Friends</em> was live from its north-facing Sixth Avenue studio, Trump had already provided the talking point of the day. “All right, well, the president says that’s fake news, it happened last June, it’s something we have to tell you have about because it’s a headline on <em>The New York Times,</em>” said <strong>Ainsley Earhardt,</strong> simultaneously dismissing the story as fake, old, and perfunctory. “What do you think about that, do you even care?” Judging from the crickets within the right-wing echo chamber, very few did.</p>\n<div class=\"embed

Unclear, but perhaps because, as the flaxen-haired good son told <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/eric-trump-american-royalty/\">CBS more than a decade ago</a>, “I know my place.” Regardless of why he was there, the segment was a real meeting of the minds: measured speech prevailed, and only one or two conspiracy theories were referenced before quickly moving on.</p>\n<p>Their conversation was all good and above board and definitely capable of passing a fact check&#8212;the elder Trump “aced” a cognitive test; the Dow, which is actually the entire economy, is about to break the glass ceiling; Trump “blew the other party out of the water”; everyone can retire now&#8212;but there was one confusing part. Eric Trump told Hannity, “I’ve told you this metaphor a thousand times, but it happens to me every single day. I walk down the street, people come up to me, they hug me. ‘Tell your father we say thank you.’”</p>\n<p>That doesn’t sound like a metaphor. It sounds like a situation that actually happens in Eric Trump’s real life. It even sounds like a believable thing that probably does really happen! In fact, it isn’t difficult to imagine that Eric wanders the expanses of Fifth Avenue on a daily basis, waiting for the hugs to come to him. Finally! After all this time! Eric Trump is getting hugs! Right in his daily to-do list is “9 A.M. to 10 A.M.: go collect your hugs.”</p>\n<p>On the other hand, though, there is no way that a 34-year-old businessman, who graduated “with honors,” to quote his Wikipedia, from Georgetown, doesn’t know what a metaphor is. So that scenario is a metaphor. It has to be. So what is this a metaphor <em>for</em>?</p>\n<p>Are the people the stock market and he’s feeling the warm embrace of dividends rising? That seems possible. Is his father the “people” who “hug” him? Confusing, and unlikely given the public relationship we’ve witnessed between the two, but maybe so. The president himself would certainly tell Eric to tell his father “thank you.” Are the “people” his Twitter followers and the street he’s “walking down” a one-way scroll consisting of everyone he hasn’t blocked? A likely story.</p>\n<p>Listen, not one of these guesses is great, but also, this isn’t a great metaphor! Hannity didn’t clarify what Trump, The Younger meant. All we know is that this “walking,” these “hugs,” these “thank yous” are not real. They are a metaphor.</p>\n<p>Trump later went on <em>Fox &amp; Friends</em> to say, in reference to the president’s reported “shithole countries” comment, “My father sees one color&#8212;green,” which is definitely not a metaphor and is extremely, very literally true. Somebody get that doctor back in here.</p>","channel":"Style","subChannel":"Celebrity","tags":["eric trump","donald trump","sean hannity","white house","vanities"],"ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"dek":"“I’ve told you this metaphor a thousand times.”","seoTitle":"Does Eric Trump Know What a Metaphor Is?","seoDescription":"“I’ve told you this metaphor a thousand times.”","socialTitle":"Does Eric Trump Know What a Metaphor Is?","socialDescription":"“I’ve told you this metaphor a thousand times.”","issueDate":"","rubric":"Daddy’s Boy","promoHed":"Does Eric Trump Know What a Metaphor Is?","promoDek":"“I’ve told you this metaphor a thousand times.”","id":"5a5f675cd458f9215fdab346","revision":31,"createdAt":"January 17, 2018 10:10 am","modifiedAt":"January 17, 2018 2:36 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"January 17, 2018 2:36 pm","_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Kenzie Bryant","filename":"Eric-Trump-Metaphor.jpg","aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1544,"height":1029,"format":"JPEG","duration":null,"url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2018/01/17/5a5f9e1dfd00b20f6e7b6ada_Eric-Trump-Metaphor.jpg"},"3:2":{"override":false,"height":1028,"width":1542,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1028,"width":1542,"x":1,"y":0}},"duration":null},"5:3":{"override":false,"height":924,"width":1540,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":924,"width":1540,"x":2,"y":0}},"duration":null},"2:3":{"override":false,"height":1029,"width":686,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1029,"width":686,"x":429,"y":0}},"duration":null},"9:16":{"override":false,"height":1024,"width":576,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1024,"width":576,"x":484,"y":0}},"duration":null},"7:3":{"override":false,"height":660,"width":1540,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":660,"width":1540,"x":2,"y":0}},"duration":null},"16:9":{"override":false,"height":864,"width":1536,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":864,"width":1536,"x":4,"y":0}},"duration":null},"4:3":{"override":false,"height":1029,"width":1372,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1029,"width":1372,"x":86,"y":0}},"duration":null},"1:1":{"override":false,"height":1029,"width":1029,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1029,"width":1029,"x":257.5,"y":0}},"duration":null}},"title":"96929249","credit":"By Justin Merriman/Getty Images.","cropMode":"TOP","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":true,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":false},"restrictCropping":false,"id":"5a5f9e1dfd00b20f6e7b6adb","revision":1,"createdAt":"January 17, 2018 2:03 pm","modifiedAt":"January 17, 2018 2:04 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"January 17, 2018 2:04 pm","caption":"Trump photographed campaigning for his father on August 3, 2017.","tags":[],"altText":"Trump photographed campaigning for his father on August 3, 2017.","description":"Getty;

Suddenly his cell phone went off.  It was Donald Trump. The new president, sworn in less than 24 hours earlier, had just seen <em>The Washington Post,</em> with photos showing Trump’s inaugural crowd dwarfed by that of his predecessor, Barack Obama.</p>\n<p>The president was livid, screaming at his chief of staff. “He said, ‘This story is <em>bullshit,</em>’ ” recalled Priebus. “He said, ‘There’s more people there. There are people who couldn’t get in the gates. . . . There’s all kind of things that were going on that made it impossible for these people to get there.’ . . . The president said, ‘Call [Interior Secretary] Ryan Zinke. Find out from the Park Service. Tell him to get a picture and do some research right away.’ ” The president wanted his chief of staff to fix this story. Immediately.</p>\n<p>Priebus tried to talk Trump off the ledge. “It doesn’t matter,” Priebus argued. “It’s Washington, D.C. We’re in an 85 percent Democrat area. Northern Virginia’s 60 percent. Maryland’s 65 percent. . . . This is a Democrat haven, and nobody cares.” But Trump was having none of it. Priebus thought, “Is this something that I really want to go to battle over on day one? Who needs a controversy over the inauguration?” Priebus realized he faced a decision: “Am I going to go to war over this with the president of the United States?”</p>\n<p>Hours later, Press Secretary Sean Spicer stepped into the White House briefing room. “What happened,” Priebus remembered, “was Spicer decided to say that actually, if you combine online and television, radio, and in-person, it was the most watched inauguration.” The trouble with that reasoning was that Spicer’s response&#8212;a belligerent, Orwellian performance beamed around the world&#8212;was a lie. From the very start, the credibility of the Trump presidency became a laughingstock, immortalized by actress Melissa McCarthy in her devastating parody of Spicer on <em>Saturday Night Live.</em></p>\n<p>On day one, instead of going to war with Donald Trump, Priebus had gone along.</p>\n<div class=\"callout small\" data-type=\"callout\"></div></section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>Priebus cannot say he wasn’t warned. Just a month before the inauguration, he had been invited to lunch by Barack Obama’s outgoing chief of staff, Denis McDonough. Following the example of a memorable breakfast hosted eight years earlier by George W. Bush’s chief Josh Bolten&#8212;when 12 former White House chiefs had come to give advice to Obama’s incoming chief, Rahm Emanuel&#8212;McDonough was joined by 10 chiefs, Republicans and Democrats, in his West Wing office. And as they gathered around a long table, none doubted the enormity of the challenge facing Priebus. “We wanted to help Reince in any way we could,” said Jack Watson, who served President Jimmy Carter. “But I don’t think there was a chief in the room that thought he was going to be able to do the job, given Trump as his president.” Most of the former chiefs believed Trump was intellectually and temperamentally unfit for office&#8212;and few thought Priebus could rein him in or tell him hard truths. “We were thinking, God bless him. Godspeed. Good luck,” said Watson. “But he doesn’t have a prayer.”</p>\n<p>Priebus was hobbled by two other factors. A former Republican National Committee chairman from Kenosha, Wisconsin, he barely knew his new boss, and he was part of the establishment that Trump had vilified. Moreover, during the campaign, the two men had been known to feud. Trump had been especially resentful of Priebus’s reaction to the campaign’s existential crisis just a month before Election Day: the release of the tawdry <em>Access Hollywood</em> tape, in which Trump had made graphic misogynist comments that were caught by an open microphone.</p>\n<p>The morning after the video surfaced, Trump’s candidacy had been pronounced all but dead in the media. In response, the beleaguered nominee’s top aides&#8212;campaign C.E.O. Stephen Bannon, former New York mayor Rudy Giu­liani, New Jersey governor Chris Christie, Jared Kushner, and Ivanka Trump&#8212;gathered at Trump Tower for a war council to advise the candidate on whether he should stay in the race or quit.</p>\n<p>The nominee, sleep-deprived, surly, his jaw clenched, posed the crucial question: in light of the videotape, what were his chances of winning? Priebus went first: “If you decide to stay in, you will lose in the biggest landslide in American political history.” One by one, Trump’s other advisers danced around the question&#8212;until finally it was Bannon’s turn. “One hundred percent,” he declared. “<em>One hundred percent you’re going to win this thing.</em> Metaphysical.” (Priebus recalled things differently, saying no one was that emphatic.)</p>\n<p>Trump, of course, pulled off an astonishing upset. And a month later, McDonough met his successor as chief of staff in the West Wing lobby and escorted him to his office. As the former chiefs went around the table, giving Priebus advice, they were unanimous about one thing: Trump would be unable to govern unless Priebus was empowered as first among equals in the West Wing. Trump’s incoming chief dutifully took notes on a yellow pad.</p>\n<p>Suddenly there was a commotion; Barack Obama was entering the room. Everyone stood and shook hands, then Obama motioned for them to sit. The 44th president’s own chiefs&#8212;Rahm Emanuel, Bill Daley, Jack Lew, McDonough, and Pete Rouse (who served unofficially)&#8212;were all pres­ent, and Obama nodded toward them. “Every one of these guys at different times told me something that pissed me off,” Obama said, flashing his familiar grin. “They weren’t always right; sometimes I was. But they were right to do that because they knew they had to tell me what I needed to hear rather than what I <em>wanted</em> to hear.” Obama looked at Priebus. “That’s the most important function of a chief of staff. Presidents need that. And I hope you will do that for President Trump.” With that, Obama said his good-byes and departed.</p>\n<p>The chiefs were not sure Priebus got the message. “I caught the eye of several of the others and we exchanged worried expressions,” one Republican in attendance remembered. “He seemed much too relaxed about being able to navigate a difficult job. I think he struck a lot of us as clueless.” Another was even more blunt about Priebus’s nonchalance: “He was approaching the job like it was some combination of personal aide and cruise director.”</p>\n<div class=\"callout omfg\" data-type=\"callout\"></div><p>Dining alone with Priebus a few weeks earlier, Bush’s chief Josh Bolten had been alarmed: Priebus seemed to regard himself as Trump’s babysitter and had given little thought to governing. “I could tell that he was nervous about leaving Trump alone and was kind of candid about ‘If I’m not there, Lord knows what happens,’” Bolten recalled. In his view, Priebus seemed “neither focused on organizing his White House staff nor in control of his own life. He was just responding to the fire of the day.”</p>\n<p>And there was another ominous sign. Obama’s staff had spent months preparing voluminous transition briefs, thick binders designed to help the next administration get up to speed on subjects ranging from Iran to Cuba to climate change. Every previous incoming team had studied such volumes with care. But as the inauguration drew near, McDonough realized that the binders had not even been opened: “All the paperwork, all the briefings that had been prepared for their transition team, went unused,” he said. “Unread. Unreviewed.”</p>\n<p>The inept start of the Trump presidency&#8212;with the flagrant lying about crowd sizes&#8212;confirmed the ex-chiefs’ worst fears. “It told me that Reince wasn’t in control,” observed Jack Watson. “It told me Reince had no power to say to the president, ‘Mr. President, we can’t do that! We are going to get <em>killed</em> if we do that.’ ” George W. Bush’s first chief, Andrew Card, watched with a sinking feeling: “I said to myself, ‘They don’t know what they’re doing. They have no process. And they don’t have discipline. You must taste your words before you spit them out!’”</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>In late October 2017, almost three months after he resigned as chief of staff, Priebus met me for dinner at a posh but empty restaurant near the White House. Wearing a blazer, tieless, and without his usual American-flag pin, he had been off the radar and had given no extensive interviews since his abrupt departure six months into his job as Trump’s chief. Unlike his friend Sean Spicer, who had struggled to find employment after his turn as Trump’s disgraced White House spokesman, Priebus had landed back at his old Washington law firm, Michael Best &amp; Friedrich LLP&#8212;as president. He was drumming up paid engagements on the lecture circuit. And he was conferring frequently by phone with Donald J. Trump.</p>\n<p>The president, Priebus said, speaks with him often on a phone that is unmonitored by John Kelly, who replaced him as Trump’s chief of staff&#8212;sometimes just to chat, sometimes for counsel. Trump often called Bannon too&#8212;at least before his excommunication following his comments in Michael Wolff’s book <em>Fire and Fury.</em> Priebus insisted, contrary to Wolff’s description, that he never called Trump an “idiot.” In fact, for all the humiliation he endured, he said, “I still love the guy. I want him to be successful.” While visiting South Korea last November to give a speech, Priebus made a side trip to the demilitarized zone between South and North, and recommended to Trump that he go there during his Asia trip. (The president and his party tried but were forced to turn back due to bad weather.)</p>\n<p>Even so, Priebus’s account of his tenure as Trump’s chief confirms the portrayal of a White House in disarray, riven by conflict. “Take everything you’ve heard and multiply it by 50,” Priebus said as we sat down. Being White House chief had been even more arduous than it looked from the outside. “No president has ever had to deal with so much so fast: a special counsel and an investigation into Russia and then subpoenas immediately, the media insanity&#8212;not to mention we were pushing out executive orders at rec­ord pace and trying to repeal and replace Obama­care right out of the gate.” Priebus was nervous, repeatedly asking, “This is all off the record, right?” (He later agreed to be quoted.)</p>\n<p>“People mistake me for a laid-back guy from the Midwest,” he continued. “I’m much more aggressive, and much more of a knife fighter. Playing the inside game is what I do.” Before Priebus, 45, accepted the job, he had had an impressive, if modest, track rec­ord. “I took the R.N.C. from oblivion,” he explained. “Our team raised a ton of money, built the biggest full-time political-party operation ever, ran two conventions, won more races than anyone else, and hit all the marks&#8212;without drama, mistakes, or infighting.”</p>\n<div class=\"embed cneembed\"><div class=\"embed block cneembed\" data-url=\"//player.cnevids.com/script/video/5a2180012d1ca01228000003.js?muted=1\"></div></div><p>At first, Priebus had been stung by the relentless criticism of his White House run and was especially sensitive to the brickbats hurled by the pundits. But with time he had understood where they came from&#8212;including a jab or two thrown by me during interviews on television news shows. “You got me real good one time on Fox,” he said. “My point is, I know what you were saying. You were saying that Trump needed someone in control, and that we had set up a weak structure. But you have to remember: the president was the Trump campaign. The R.N.C. was the organization&#8212;but he accomplished almost everything in his life by himself. The idea that he was suddenly going to accept an immediate and elaborate staff structure regulating every minute of his life was never in the cards.</p>\n<p>“One of the things all [the chiefs] told me,” Priebus said, “was: don’t take the job unless you’re designated A number 1, in charge of everything, beginning to end.” All of that was right for a typical president, Priebus thought, but Trump wasn’t typical; he was one of a kind.</p>\n<p>As it turned out, there was a moment on Election Night when it looked as though the chief’s job might go to Bannon, who eventually became Priebus’s ally in the West Wing. (Others would be considered as well.) But he didn’t look the part. “Trump looked around and I remember I had a combat jacket on and I hadn’t shaved in a week,” said Bannon, who spoke with me at length just before the release of <em>Fire and Fury.</em> “I had the greasy hair [hanging] down. . . . I’m the senior guy&#8212;but look, it was obvious Reince had to be chief of staff.” Priebus, however, would be chief in name only: Trump, instead, anointed Bannon as Priebus’s co-equal, with Bannon, Trump’s chief strategist, getting top billing.</p>\n<div class=\"callout omfg\" data-type=\"callout\"></div><p>From the beginning, Priebus would face a challenge unique to this presidency: how to curb the commander in chief’s tweets. “We can get thrown off our message by tweeting things that aren’t the issues of the day,” he told Trump. At first Priebus thought he had succeeded in wresting Trump’s phone from him. “I talked about the security threat of having your own cell in the West Wing and got the Secret Service to go along with me to mothball his phone.” Priebus had managed to silence one device. But it turned out Trump had another.</p>\n<p>Early on, the staff wrote daily tweets <em>for</em> him: “The team would give the president five or six tweets every day to choose from,” said Priebus, “and some of them would real­ly push the envelope. The idea would be at least they would be tweets that we could see and understand and control. But that didn’t allow the president to be fully in control of his own voice. Everybody tried at different times to cool down the Twitter habit&#8212;but no one could do it. . . . After [last year’s] joint session [of Congress] we all talked to him, and Melania said, ‘No tweeting.’ And he said, ‘O.K.&#8212;for the next few days.’ We had many discussions involving this issue. We had meetings in the residence. I couldn’t stop it. [But] it’s now part of the American culture and the American presidency. And you know what? In many ways, the president was right. And all of us so-called experts might be totally wrong.</p>\n<p>“[Trump] is a man who fears no one and nothing,” continued Priebus, “and there is absolutely nothing he’s intimidated by. . . . And that’s very rare in politics. Most people in politics are people who have sort of an approval addiction. Now, granted, President Trump does too, but he’s willing to weather one storm after the next to get to an end result that most people are not willing to weather. . . . He doesn’t mind the craziness, the drama, or the difficulty, as long as an end goal is in sight. He will endure it.”</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>Soon after the inauguration, the president began to lash out wildly at members of the Justice Department who were poised to open probes into possible misconduct or overreach by members of his administration. On his 11th day in office, he fired Acting Attorney General Sally Yates for refusing to enforce his controversial travel ban. Then Preet Bharara, U.S. attorney for New York’s Southern District. Next up: F.B.I. director James Comey.</p>\n<p>Priebus and White House counsel Donald McGahn tried to stall the freight train coming toward them, sensing that sacking Comey would be a fateful political mistake. But Jared Kushner supported Trump’s decision, and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein’s memo&#8212;criticizing the F.B.I. director’s handling of the Hillary Clinton investigation&#8212;gave Trump the pretext. On May 9, Trump fired Comey. It would trigger the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel and would prove to be among the most politically disastrous decisions since Richard Nixon fired Watergate prosecutor Archibald Cox.</p>\n<div class=\"callout large has-pullquote\" data-type=\"callout\"><div class=\"embed pullquote\" data-type=\"pullquote\"><span><blockquote>\n<p>“[White House counsel] Don McGahn said, ‘We’ve got a problem. . . .\n[Jeff] Sessions just resigned.’”</p>\n</blockquote>\n</span><div class=\"component-social-share pullquote mono closed\" data-component=\"SocialShare\" role=\"list\"><div class=\"share-item twitter\" data-component=\"twitter\" data-href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=%22%0A%E2%80%9C%5BWhite%20House%20counsel%5D%20Don%20McGahn%20said%2C%20%E2%80%98We%E2%80%99ve%20got%20a%20problem.%20.%20.%20.%0A%5BJeff%5D%20Sessions%20just%20resigned.%E2%80%99%E2%80%9D%0A%0A%22&amp;via=VanityFair&amp;url=\" role=\"listitem\"><a aria-label=\"Tweet\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=%22%0A%E2%80%9C%5BWhite%20House%20counsel%5D%20Don%20McGahn%20said%2C%20%E2%80%98We%E2%80%99ve%20got%20a%20problem.%20.%20.%20.%0A%5BJeff%5D%20Sessions%20just%20resigned.%E2%80%99%E2%80%9D%0A%0A%22&amp;via=VanityFair&amp;url=\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"icon\"></span><span class=\"label\">Twitter</span></a></div></div></div></div><p>While Priebus and Bannon watched the fiasco explode as the pundits excoriated the Trump White House on every cable news show, Kushner did a slow burn. He was livid, furious that the communications team could not defend Comey’s firing. Bannon blew his stack. “There’s not a fucking thing you can do to sell this!,” he shouted at Kushner. “<em>Nobody</em> can sell this! <em>P. T. Barnum</em> couldn’t sell this! People aren’t stupid! This is a terrible, stupid decision that’s going to have massive implications. It may have shortened Trump’s presidency&#8212;and it’s because of <em>you, Jared Kushner!</em>”</p>\n<p>The screaming matches and white-knuckle showdowns continued. Eight days later, Priebus got an unexpected visit from the White House counsel&#8212;a story he has not told publicly before. “Don McGahn came in my office pretty hot, red, out of breath, and said, ‘We’ve got a problem.’ I responded, ‘What?’ And he said, ‘Well, we just got a special counsel, and [Attorney General Jeff] Sessions just resigned.’ I said, ‘<em>What!?</em> What the hell are you talking about?’ ”</p>\n<p>It was bad enough that Trump, having fired Comey, would now be the target of a special prosecutor. Even worse, unbeknownst to Priebus, the president, only moments before, had subjected Sessions to a withering tirade in the Oval Office, calling him an “idiot” and blaming Sessions’s recusal from the Russia investigation for the whole mess. Humiliated, Sessions said he would resign.</p>\n<p>Priebus was incredulous: “I said, ‘That can’t happen.’” He bolted down the stairway to the West Wing parking lot. He found Sessions in the backseat of a black sedan, with the engine running. “I knocked on the door of the car, and Jeff was sitting there,” Priebus said, “and I just jumped in and shut the door, and I said, ‘Jeff, what’s going on?’ And then he told me that he was going to resign. I said, ‘You cannot resign. It’s not possible. We are going to talk about this right now.’ So I dragged him back up to my office from the car. [Vice President Mike] Pence and Bannon came in, and we started talking to him to the point where he decided that he would not resign right then and he would instead think about it.” Later that night, Sessions delivered a resignation letter to the Oval Office, but, Priebus claimed, he ultimately persuaded the president to give it back.</p>\n<p>In June, Trump was still on a tear. He considered dumping special counsel Mueller, according to <em>The New York Times,</em> but was dissuaded from doing so. And by July, Trump was back on Sessions’s case, tweeting insults and calling him “weak.” “Priebus was told to get Sessions’s resignation flat out,” said a White House insider. “The president told him, ‘Don’t give me any bullshit. Don’t try to slow me down like you always do. Get the resignation of Jeff Sessions.’ ”</p>\n<p>Once more, Priebus stalled Trump, recalled a White House insider. “He told the president, ‘If I get this resignation, you are in for a spiral of calamity that makes Comey look like a picnic.’ Rosenstein’s going to resign. [Associate Attorney General] Rachel Brand, the number three, will say, ‘Forget it. I’m not going to be involved with this.’ And it is going to be a total mess.” The president agreed to hold off. (Sessions didn’t comment on the resignation letter and last July publicly stated that he planned to stay on the job “as long as that is appropriate.” Brand, in fact, resigned this month.)</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>The Trump presidency’s first six months were the most incompetent and least accomplished in modern history. And its very survival was clouded by the gathering storm of the special prosecutor’s probe.</p>\n<p>When it came to Mueller’s investigation, Priebus insisted he personally had nothing to worry about. But Bannon warned that the hounds had been loosed. “You’ve got Mueller’s team, which has got 19 killers who are all experts in wire fraud, money-laundering, and tax evasion,” Bannon said. “Doesn’t sound like collusion to me. But they’ve got unlimited budgets and subpoena power. And here’s what we’ve got on our side: two guys who’ve got legal pads and Post-Its.</p>\n<div class=\"callout omfg\" data-type=\"callout\"></div><p>“It’s like [certain members of the administration think that] no one took down the Gambino family,” Bannon continued. “Mueller’s doing a roll-up just like he did with the Gambinos. [Former campaign manager Paul] Manafort’s the <em>caporegime,</em> right? And [Rick] Gates [Manafort’s deputy] is a made man! [George] Papadopoulos is equivalent to a wiseguy out in a social club in Brooklyn. This is like a Wagner opera. In the overture you get all the strands of the music you’re going to hear for three hours. Well, Mueller opened with a bang. He totally caught these guys by surprise. So if you’re not going to fight, you’re going to get rolled over.”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Trump’s campaign to eradicate Obamacare went nowhere. “Repeal and replace” crashed and burned&#8212;not once but twice, the second time when John McCain delivered a dramatic 1:30 a.m. thumbs-down on the Senate floor. The debacle proved that Priebus could not count&#8212;or deliver&#8212;votes. “When McCain voted against it,” Bannon recalled, “I said to myself, Reince is gone. This is going to be so bad. The president is going to get so lit up.”</p>\n<p>Priebus soon became a target of Trump’s ritual belittling as the president took to referring to him as “Reincey.” At one point, he summoned Priebus&#8212;to swat a fly. Priebus seemed to have been willing to endure almost any indignity to stay in Trump’s favor. There was that scene right out of <em>The Manchurian Candidate</em> when, at a Cabinet meeting, the president’s most powerful advisers virtually competed to see who could be more obsequious; Priebus won hands down, declaring what a “blessing” it was to serve the president.</p>\n<p>By the summer, however, Priebus knew that his job hung by a thread. According to insiders, he was already in the crosshairs of “Javanka/Jarvanka”&#8212;as Bannon would take to calling the president’s daughter and son-in-law&#8212;for refusing to help Kushner in his efforts to oust Bannon. And then came the last straw: the sudden arrival of a new, flamboyant communications director, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/02/the-mooch-recalls-his-10-days-in-the-swamp\">Anthony Scaramucci</a>. Priebus had opposed his hiring. Scaramucci immediately turned the West Wing into a circular firing squad, calling Trump’s chief of staff a “fucking paranoid schizophrenic” in an interview with <em>The New Yorker.</em> He went on, in a tweet, to all but accuse Priebus of leaking classified information about Scaramucci’s finances (which were publicly available). “When he accused me of a felony,” recalled Priebus, “I thought, What am I doing here? . . . I went in to the president and said, ‘I gotta go.’ ” Trump would say nothing publicly in Priebus’s defense. The president accepted his resignation.</p>\n<p>Priebus had hoped to exit gracefully within a week or two, but the next day, as Air Force One sat on the tarmac at Andrews Air Force Base, Trump tweeted, “I am pleased to inform you that I have just named General/Secretary John F Kelly as White House Chief of Staff. He is a Great American. . . . ” The sudden shake-up was vintage Trump; the timing blindsided Priebus, who stepped off the plane into a drenching rain and was whisked away by car.</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>John Kelly, a four-star Marine general who had run the Southern Command, was 22 years Priebus’s senior. At the start, he had the president’s full confidence and wasted no time transforming the West Wing into a tighter ship. All visitors to the Oval Office&#8212;including Bannon, Kushner, and even the president’s adviser-daughter, Ivanka&#8212;were now vetted by the chief. Kelly also started heaving loose cannons over the side: Scaramucci was fired within 72 hours of Kelly’s appointment; Sebastian Gorka, another overzealous White House staffer, would soon follow; even Bannon himself would be gone within a month. Kelly declared that he was not put on earth to manage the president; instead, he would impose discipline on the staff and streamline the flow of information to the Oval Office.</p>\n<p>Still, expectations were high that Kelly would be the “grown-up in the room,” who would smooth over Trump’s authoritarian edges. And yet, week after week&#8212;during the president’s fulminations against “fake news,” his sympathetic comments toward white supremacists who marched through Charlottesville, his taunting of “Rocket Man” before the U.N. General Assembly, and his racist slurs against “shithole countries”&#8212;Kelly stood at Trump’s side. He not only reinforced the president’s worst instincts; he doubled down on them. He maligned Congresswoman Frederica Wilson from the White House Press Briefing Room with a false story after she criticized Trump’s handling of a Gold Star widow. In early February, the news broke that Kelly’s deputy Rob Porter&#8212;accused of beating both of his ex-wives (Porter denied the allegations)&#8212;had served in the sensitive post of staff secretary for more than a year without a permanent security clearance. The debacle surrounding his abrupt resignation showed that Kelly could not manage the West Wing, let alone Trump.</p>\n<p>Suddenly Kelly’s future looked uncertain. And Priebus looked more effective in hindsight. “Reince was better than his press,” said Bannon. “If Reince had the exact track record that Kelly has, he would be deemed the worst chief of staff in the history of politics&#8212;and that’s not a slam on Kelly. . . . Folks felt [Priebus] didn’t have the gravitas. He’s always the little guy from Kenosha, right?”</p>\n<p>Adapted from <em><a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/231946/the-gatekeepers-by-chris-whipple/\">The Gatekeepers: How the White House Chiefs of Staff Define Every Presidency</a>,</em> by Chris Whipple, to be published in paperback on March 6, 2018, by Crown, an imprint of The Crown Publishing Group, a division of Penguin Random House LLC; © 2017, 2018 by the author.</p>\n</section>","channel":"News","subChannel":"Politics","tags":[],"ledeCaption":"Reince Priebus (right) with President Donald Trump in the Oval Office, January 2017.","contentSource":"magazine","canonicalUrl":"","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"dek":"Months after his chaotic resignation as chief of staff, and with his successor on the hot seat, Priebus comes clean about everything: the inauguration crowd-size fiasco, the decision to fire Comey, the Mooch, the tweets, how he helped save Jeff Sessions’s job, and his mercurial former boss. “I still love the guy,” he says.","seoTitle":"“Who Needs a Controversy Over the Inauguration?”: Reince Priebus Opens Up About His Six Months of Magical Thinking","seoDescription":"Months after his chaotic resignation as chief of staff, and with his successor on the hot seat, Priebus comes clean about everything: the inauguration crowd-size fiasco, the decision to fire Comey, the Mooch, the tweets, how he helped saved Jeff Sessions’s job, and his mercurial former boss. “I still love the guy,” he says.","socialTitle":"“Who Needs a Controversy Over the Inauguration?”: Reince Priebus Opens Up About His Six Months of Magical Thinking","socialDescription":"Months after his chaotic resignation as chief of staff, and with his successor on the hot seat, Priebus comes clean about everything: the inauguration crowd-size fiasco, the decision to fire Comey, the Mooch, the tweets, how he helped saved Jeff Sessions’s job, and his mercurial former boss. “I still love the guy,” he says.","issueDate":"March 2018","rubric":"From the Magazine","promoHed":"“Who Needs a Controversy Over the Inauguration?”: Reince Priebus Opens Up About His Six Months of Magical Thinking","promoDek":"Months after his chaotic resignation as chief of staff, and with his successor on the hot seat, Priebus comes clean about everything: the inauguration crowd-size fiasco, the decision to fire Comey, the Mooch, the tweets, how he helped saved Jeff Sessions’s job, and his mercurial former boss. “I still love the guy,” he says.","id":"5a846289bd28cc578e6d82e1","revision":23,"createdAt":"February 14, 2018 11:23 am","modifiedAt":"February 16, 2018 10:43 am","revisionCreatedAt":"February 16, 2018 10:43 am","_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Erin Vanderhoof","filename":"t-reince-preibus-2018-03.jpg","aspectRatios":{"3:2":{"width":1998,"height":1332,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1332,"width":1998,"x":1,"y":0}},"duration":null},"5:3":{"width":2000,"height":1200,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":0,"y":132,"height":1200,"width":2000}},"duration":null},"2:3":{"width":887,"height":1331,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":1112,"y":0,"height":1331,"width":887}},"duration":null},"9:16":{"width":746,"height":1327,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":1253,"y":5,"height":1327,"width":746}},"duration":null},"7:3":{"width":1994,"height":854,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":5,"y":289,"height":854,"width":1994}},"duration":null},"16:9":{"width":2000,"height":1125,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":0,"y":207,"height":1125,"width":2000}},"duration":null},"4:3":{"width":1775,"height":1331,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":224,"y":0,"height":1331,"width":1775}},"duration":null},"1:1":{"width":1332,"height":1332,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":589,"y":0,"height":1332,"width":1332}},"duration":null},"master":{"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2018/02/14/5a8488a37d9068584d650dbf_t-reince-preibus-2018-03.jpg","width":2000,"height":1333,"duration":null}},"title":"t-reince-preibus-2018-03.jpg","credit":"Photograph by Andrew Harnik/A.P.

As <a href=\"http://www.cbs.com/shows/celebrity-big-brother/\">CBS</a> announced during the Grammys Sunday night, one of the highest-paid advisers to the president, who left the White House in a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/12/omarosa-manigault-resigned\">flurry of scandal</a> in December, will appear on <em>Celebrity Big Brother,</em> premiering next week.</p>\n<p>The show is a spin-off of <em>Big Brother,</em> in which a group of strangers are filmed living in a house that’s cut off from the outside world. There’s an elimination each week and a $500,000 grand prize to be won. She’ll appear alongside <strong>Mark McGrath</strong> (frontman of Sugar Ray), <strong>Shannon Elizabeth</strong> (of the <em>Scary Movie</em> franchise), <strong>Metta World Peace</strong> (née <strong>Ron Artest,</strong> of the N.B.A.), and <strong>Brandi Glanville</strong> (former Real Housewife of Beverly Hills), among others. The competition must look easy compared to <strong>John Kelly</strong> or <strong>Hope Hicks.</strong></p>\n<p>Kelly fired Omarosa or she resigned, depending on who you ask, in mid-December. She nearly made it one year as the “assistant to the president” and director of communications for the Office of Public Liaison in <strong>Donald Trump’s</strong> administration. The job paid $179,700, the maximum salary for any White House staffer, but complaints dogged her throughout her tenure. They ranged from the distracting questions she asked in meetings to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/11/omarosa-manigault-wedding-bridesmaid-luncheon-shoes-white-house\">using the White House</a> as a backdrop to her wedding events (even on the day <strong>Angela Merkel</strong> visited) to her willy-nilly shoe-storage system.</p>\n<p>Before she officially hung up her hat, Omarosa stopped by <em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/12/omarosa-manigault-gma-interview\">Good Morning America</a>,</em> where she seemed to be shopping some sort of tell-all, saying, “[W]hen I have my story to tell as the only African-American woman in this White House; as a senior staff and assistant to the president, I have seen things that have made me uncomfortable, that have upset me, that have affected me deeply and emotionally, that has affected my community and my people. And when I can tell my story, it is a profound story that I know the world will want to hear.”</p>\n<p>For her first act, however, Omarosa is setting out on a clearly defined career path, or at least one that’s well-trod for her. Reality shows are what she knows best. After rising to national fame as the villain on Trump’s <em>The Apprentice</em> (and returning to the show in different iterations or as a surprise guest), she appeared on <em>Fear Factor,</em> <em>Celebrity Poker Showdown,</em> <em>The Surreal Life,</em> and <em>Hollywood Medium.</em> Even while she was in the White House, Omarosa took a turn on TLC’s <em>Say Yes to the Dress.</em> Omarosa is a reality-television lifer.</p>\n<p>Along with <strong>Reince Priebus,</strong> who returned to his former job at the Wisconsin-based firm Michael Best &amp; Friedrich LLP, Omarosa is one of the few former Trump staffers of note to get back on the old horse successfully. <strong>Steve Bannon</strong> returned to Breitbart, and <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/01/breitbart-post-bannon-landscape\">was quickly ousted</a> in the fallout from <strong>Michael Wolff’s</strong> <em>Fire and Fury.</em> <strong>Sean Spicer</strong> announced he’s <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/12/11/sean-spicer-announces-book-to-set-the-record-straight-about-trumps-campaign-presidency/\">writing a book</a>, out this July, but is not currently employed elsewhere. <strong>Anthony Scaramucci</strong> has maybe, possibly launched his own media effort, the “Scaramucci Post.” He once <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/11/anthony-scaramucci-comeback-2020\">described</a> it tenuously, saying, “We have absolutely no idea what the Scaramucci Post is, and neither do you.”</p>\n<p>Typically, former aides get mint positions in their post-White House life, whether they enter the world of punditry or take a walk on the private side or join top-tier law firms around Washington. Omarosa appears to have the most well-defined and highest-profile gig yet though. She could pull a Bannon, and get voted off in the first or second week of her new venture, but for now, it looks like business as usual for the reality-television cockroach.</p>","channel":"Style","subChannel":"Celebrity","tags":["omarosa","donald trump","white house","metta world peace","Omarosa Manigault

House, <strong>Steve Bannon</strong> was portrayed on <em>Saturday Night Live</em> in a way that probably would have suited him just fine, as a cloaked figure in a grim reaper mask looming in the Oval Office. (Cast member <strong>Mikey Day</strong> was under that cloak, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mikeyfuntime/status/901137306530263043?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fdeadline.com%2F2017%2F08%2Fsnl-grim-reaper-mikey-day-steve-bannon-saturday-night-live-1202156581%2F\">tweeted a farewell</a> to the mask after Bannon was fired last August.)</p>\n<p>But now that Bannon isn’t just out of the White House but <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/01/breitbart-post-bannon-landscape\">deeply on the outs</a> with the people who made him famous, <em>Saturday Night Live</em>’s writers aren’t likely to bring him back into the action any time soon. So they gave him a farewell honor, of sorts, by finally removing the grim reaper mask to reveal . . . <strong>Bill Murray</strong>??</p>\n<p>Outfitted in a “wrinkled barn jacket,” some lovingly applied facial splotches, and a truly luxurious wig, Murray popped up near the end of a <em>Morning Joe</em> sketch, sitting next to <strong>Michael Wolff</strong> (<strong>Fred Armisen</strong> in an eerily dead-on impression) to refute some of the claims made in Wolff’s new book <em>Fire and Fury.</em> “No one gets the Bannon fired,” Murray’s Bannon claimed. “I never said Don Jr. was treasonous.”</p>\n<p>“Yes you did,” Armisen’s Wolff responded.</p>\n<p>“Well, I certainly never said he cracked like an egg on TV.”</p>\n<p>“Yes you did, that sounds exactly like you.”</p>\n<p>“O.K. that does sound like me,” Murray’s Bannon concluded. “Thank you, good reporting.”</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/nbcsnl/status/952402779062067200/video/1\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/nbcsnl/status/952402779062067200/video/1\">https://twitter.com/nbcsnl/status/952402779062067200/video/1</a></p></blockquote></div><p>Bannon went on to detail all of his post-Breitbart plans, including a Crackle series called (<em>Cucks in Cars Getting Coffee,</em> a menswear line called Frumpers, and a skincare line called Blotch. He also claimed to be hard at work finding the next Trump-like unlikely political leader. “Logan Paul. Martin Shkreli. Jared the Subway guy. It’s time for America to slide down the Bannonster.” On that last line, Murray&#8212;a <em>Saturday Night Live</em> veteran famous for his deadpan&#8212;couldn’t resist cracking up.</p>\n<p>At this point nearly all of the most famous impressions of Trump administration members belong to superstars who aren’t in the regular <em>S.N.L.</em> cast&#8212; <strong>Alec Baldwin</strong> set the template as Trump (an impression no one thought would last beyond the election), then <strong>Melissa McCarthy</strong> ushered in the show’s period of hyper-relevance as <strong>Sean Spicer,</strong> the Emmy-winning impression that likely inadvertently sparked Spicer’s <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/09/colbert-emmys-sean-spicer-skit\">pop-culture comeback</a>. It seems likely that Murray only took the Bannon job, though, knowing that it would be a onetime thing. And it was a far more political appearance for Murray than the last time he returned to 30 Rock, showing up in October 2016 to celebrate the World Series victory of his beloved Chicago Cubs. But a lot has changed since the fall of 2016, after all. And when there’s a former White House employee best captured by a grim reaper mask, who better to send him off in splotchy style than Murray?</p>","channel":"Hollywood","subChannel":"Television","tags":["saturday night live","snl","bill murray","steve bannon"],"ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"dek":"So <em>that’s</em> who was under that grim reaper mask all along.","seoTitle":"Saturday Night Live Reveals Bill Murray as Their Steve Bannon","seoDescription":"So that’s who was under that grim reaper mask all along.","socialTitle":"Saturday Night Live Reveals Bill Murray as Their Steve Bannon","socialDescription":"So that’s who was under that grim reaper mask all along.","issueDate":"","rubric":"Live From New York","promoHed":"<em>Saturday Night Live</em> Reveals Bill Murray as Their Steve Bannon","promoDek":"So <em>that</em>’s who was under that grim reaper mask all along.","id":"5a5ae12b057a2c6758d78070","revision":15,"createdAt":"January 13, 2018 11:48 pm","modifiedAt":"January 16, 2018 12:08 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"January 16, 2018 12:08 pm","_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Katherine Rich","filename":"bill-murray-steve-bannon-snl.jpg","aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":690,"height":460,"format":"JPEG","duration":null,"url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2018/01/14/5a5ae2aa0ba3dc230ebe7670_bill-murray-steve-bannon-snl.jpg"},"3:2":{"override":false,"height":460,"width":690,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":460,"width":690,"x":0,"y":0}},"duration":null},"5:3":{"override":false,"height":414,"width":690,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":414,"width":690,"x":0,"y":0}},"duration":null},"2:3":{"override":false,"height":459,"width":306,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":459,"width":306,"x":192,"y":0}},"duration":null},"9:16":{"override":false,"height":448,"width":252,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":448,"width":252,"x":219,"y":0}},"duration":null},"7:3":{"override":false,"height":294,"width":686,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":294,"width":686,"x":2,"y":0}},"duration":null},"16:9":{"override":false,"height":387,"width":688,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":387,"width":688,"x":1,"y":0}},"duration":null},"4:3":{"override":false,"height":459,"width":612,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":459,"width":612,"x":39,"y":0}},"duration":null},"1:1":{"override":false,"height":460,"width":460,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":460,"width":460,"x":115,"y":0}},"duration":null}},"title":"bill-murray-steve-bannon-snl.jpg","cropMode":"TOP","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":true,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":false},"restrictCropping":false,"id":"5a5ae2aa0ba3dc230ebe7671","revision":0,"createdAt":"January 13, 2018 11:55 pm","modifiedAt":"January 13, 2018 11:55 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"January 13, 2018 11:55 pm","modelName":"photo","collection":"photos","altText":""}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"bio":"Katey Rich is the deputy editor of VanityFair.com.

Stay tuned!” He would then <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/950103659337134080\">delay</a> the awards, which stand to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/15/trump-fake-news-awards-ethics-339183\">run afoul</a> of both White House rules and the First Amendment, by one week due to the fact that “the interest in, and importance of, these awards is far greater than anyone could have anticipated!” And though we are now well into January, it remains unclear what form the awards ceremony, which is scheduled for Wednesday, will take, or whether it will happen at all. (Press Secretary <strong>Sarah Huckabee Sanders</strong> referred to the awards ceremony as a “potential event” during <a href=\"https://twitter.com/christinawilkie/status/953380327589863424\">Tuesday’s press briefing</a>).</p>\n<p>Should the ceremony take place, it would represent a culmination of Trump’s continuous <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/950023175907266560\">attacks</a> on certain outlets as “fake.” And though the president’s attacks are clearly designed to sow doubt in reports that hold him accountable, the growing prominence of conspiracy theories reflects a mounting distrust of authority, while the speed with which they spread highlights tech platforms’ alarming ability to amplify them. But in the spirit of the current administration, which seems dead set on trivializing the problem, the Hive has compiled the top six biggest fake-news stories of 2017.</p>\n<p><strong>Melania Trump’s body double</strong></p>\n<p>In October, a theory about First Lady <strong>Melania Trump</strong> briefly gripped the Internet. Though it began as a joke, it quickly morphed into a full-fledged <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Andreawagnerbarton/posts/10214853731877308\">conspiracy</a>: the First Lady employed a look-alike who regularly filled in for her during certain public appearances. Internet sleuths pointed to the president’s slipups regarding his wife’s whereabouts (“My wife, Melania, who happens to be right here,” he says in one widely circulated clip); her sometimes-altered-looking appearance; and a similar-looking Secret Service agent as apparent proof that the president’s wife was actually an impostor. Snopes.com quickly <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/melania-trump-body-double/\">flagged this as false</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>The Roy Moore setup</strong></p>\n<p>In the wake of a bombshell <em>Washington Post</em> report <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/11/roy-moore-urged-to-resign-after-report-of-relationships-with-teens\">alleging</a> that Republican Alabama Senate candidate <strong>Roy Moore</strong> had pursued sexual contact with minors, Moore supporters leapt to his defense. One Web site circulated the (false) news that a Moore accuser <a href=\"http://archive.is/0fpXU\">had been arrested</a> for lying, and right-wing blog the Gateway Pundit <a href=\"https://archive.fo/5JBdI#selection-563.0-563.216\">wrote about a tweet</a> that claimed <em>The Washington Post</em> had paid women to fabricate stories about Moore. Before the election, Alabama voters received a <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/roy-moore-washington-post-robocall_us_5a0b70f6e4b00a6eece4fe53\">robocall</a> from someone who claimed to be “Bernie Bernstein,” a <em>Post</em> reporter who sought to offer money for “damaging remarks” about Moore, and the <em>Post</em> itself reported on an attempted sting operation by Project Veritas, the right-wing gotcha-journalism outfit run by <strong>James O’Keefe,</strong> which had tried to plant false accusations about Moore with a <em>Post</em> reporter. Moore lost the December special Senate race, but barely.</p>\n<p><strong>The Seth Rich conspiracy</strong></p>\n<p>When Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich was <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/24/us/seth-rich-dnc-wikileaks-theories/index.html\">murdered</a> in July 2016, his death quickly became a fulcrum for misinformation. WikiLeaks offered $20,000 in cash for information about Rich’s untimely death, and WikiLeaks proprietor <strong>Julian Assange</strong> suggested on a Dutch radio show that Rich may have played a role in the D.N.C. hack that was later tied to Russian operatives. <strong>Roger Stone</strong> suggested that Rich had been killed by the Clintons to cover up the evidence. (In reality, Washington, D.C. police say Rich was likely the victim of a botched robbery). A Fox News story in May 2017 <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/05/sean-hannity-seth-rich-conspiracy-theory\">added fuel to the conspiracy fire</a>, but the story quickly fell apart as Rich’s family begged <strong>Sean Hannity</strong> to stop spreading “baseless accusations.”</p>\n<p><strong>Trump’s voter-fraud fever dream</strong></p>\n<p>Though the most recent presidential election began and ended on November 8, 2016, the news cycle surrounding it churns on, helped along by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/802972944532209664\">Trump’s Twitter feed</a>. In late January of last year, an article from YourNewsWire&#8212;a Los Angeles-based Web site that runs aggregated political news mixed in with completely fabricated stories, and has claimed, among other things, that <strong>Justin Bieber</strong> <a href=\"http://archive.is/WTOCr\">told</a> a Bible study group that the music industry is run by pedophiles&#8212;wrote that <a href=\"http://archive.is/earRt\">25 million fraudulent votes</a> had been cast for <strong>Hilary Clinton.</strong> “A study published by NPR reveals that over 25 million Hillary Clinton votes were completely fraudulent, meaning that the Democratic candidate actually lost the popular vote by a huge margin,” the story read. Of course, this is <a href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2017/08/25-million-clinton-votes-werent-fake/\">completely false</a>; the NPR study in question wasn’t conducted by NPR at all. It was a 2012 article published by NPR about a Pew Research Center report issued the same year, which noted that “approximately 24 million voter registrations in the United States are no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate.” NPR noted that “there’s little evidence that this has led to widespread voter fraud.”</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/beckerdavidj/status/803301967875321857\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/beckerdavidj/status/803301967875321857\">https://twitter.com/beckerdavidj/status/803301967875321857</a></p></blockquote></div><p>The theory gained so much traction that the president established the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity to investigate the matter, but after issuing a series of <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/06/trump-kobach-voter-fraud\">untoward requests</a>, the committee was dissolved this month after it found <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/01/trump-voter-fraud-commission\">no evidence of voter fraud</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Trump’s inauguration crowd size</strong></p>\n<p>Before he relinquished the unenviable job of White House press secretary, <strong>Sean Spicer</strong> was tasked with <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/343204-sean-spicers-most-memorable-moments-as-press-secretary\">convincing reporters</a> that Trump’s inauguration had drawn “the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period, both in person and around the globe.” After a comparison of <strong>Barack Obama’s</strong> 2009 inauguration crowd size and Trump’s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/20/us/politics/trump-inauguration-crowd.html\">went viral</a>, an analysis of both crowds <a href=\"http://time.com/4643927/sean-spicer-white-house-donald-trump-inauguration-press-briefing/\">showed</a> that Trump’s was about one-third the size of Obama’s.</p>\n<p>Following his resignation, Spicer walked back the first assertion he’d made on the job, <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/367490-spicer-i-screwed-up-in-comments-about-inauguration-crowd-size\">saying in an interview</a> that he had “screwed up” a number of times as press secretary.</p>\n<p><strong>Viral terrorist attacks</strong></p>\n<p>In almost the same instant that news broke of a shooting in Las Vegas that left at least 59 dead and hundreds wounded, false information <a href=\"http://beta.latimes.com/nation/la-las-vegas-shooting-live-updates-fake-news-stories-circulate-after-1506961659-htmlstory.html\">began to circulate</a> about its circumstances. Some social-media posts included a picture of comedian <strong>Sam Hyde</strong> falsely claiming he was the gunman; other rumors suggested that multiple shooters had been involved. After the terror attack in Manchester, England, at an <strong>Ariana Grande</strong> concert in May, viral photos <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/jimwaterson/manchester-arena-fake-news?utm_term=.mjbj7ZWMr#.by3PDvdWx\">claiming</a> to show missing children were widely circulated on Facebook and Twitter, despite the fact that many pictured were in different continents at the time of the attack.</p>\n<p>A number of these stories received boosts from Facebook’s own algorithms; the YourNewsWire story about fraudulent Clinton votes was among Facebook’s most-shared viral news stories of 2017, according to <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/these-are-50-of-the-biggest-fake-news-hits-on-facebook-in?utm_term=.pgllE8A2z5#.xtG2LmjYnN\">analysis</a> by BuzzFeed News. In 2017 as a whole, Facebook saw a marked uptick in users’ engagement with fake-news stories. In an attempt to minimize the impact of such stories, Facebook last week <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/01/facebook-news-feed-change-update-publishers\">introduced changes</a> to its News Feed that will promote posts from friends and family, and de-emphasize posts from publishers (or any official page).</p>\n<p>But the effort to combat fake news faces an obstacle still more daunting than social-media algorithms: Americans themselves can’t even agree on <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/16/americans-fake-news-study-339184\">what the phrase means</a>. Though it originally referred to a falsified news story, it’s come to mean any hyper-partisan news story, or even a story with which the reader disagrees, regardless of how factual it is.</p>","channel":"News","subChannel":"Politics","tags":["donald trump","melania trump","roy moore","story","seth rich"],"ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"dek":"In advance of President Trump’s Fake-News Awards, a retrospective on the year’s least credible stories.","seoTitle":"The 6 Fakest Fake-News Stories of 2017","seoDescription":"In advance of President Trump’s Fake-News Awards, a retrospective on the year’s least credible stories.","socialTitle":"The 6 Fakest Fake-News Stories of 2017","socialDescription":"In advance of President Trump’s Fake-News Awards, a retrospective on the year’s least credible stories.","issueDate":"","rubric":"Fake News","promoHed":"The 6 Fakest Fake-News Stories of 2017","promoDek":"In advance of President Trump’s Fake-News Awards, a retrospective on the year’s least credible stories.","id":"5a5f6cc30a0f745c9c4dc884","revision":13,"createdAt":"January 17, 2018 10:33 am","modifiedAt":"January 17, 2018 1:42 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"January 17, 2018 1:42 pm","_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Jordan Amchin","filename":"6-Fakest-Fake-Stories-2.png","aspectRatios":{"3:2":{"width":1542,"height":1028,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1028,"width":1542,"x":1,"y":0}},"duration":null},"5:3":{"width":1540,"height":924,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":924,"width":1540,"x":2,"y":0}},"duration":null},"2:3":{"width":490,"height":735,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":605,"y":293,"height":735,"width":490}},"duration":null},"9:16":{"width":575,"height":1023,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":560,"y":0,"height":1023,"width":575}},"duration":null},"7:3":{"width":1539,"height":659,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":0,"y":169,"height":659,"width":1539}},"duration":null},"16:9":{"width":1536,"height":864,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":864,"width":1536,"x":4,"y":0}},"duration":null},"4:3":{"width":1372,"height":1029,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1029,"width":1372,"x":86,"y":0}},"duration":null},"1:1":{"width":1029,"height":1029,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1029,"width":1029,"x":257.5,"y":0}},"duration":null},"master":{"format":"PNG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2018/01/17/5a5f98dbdd94fc12188411ee_6-Fakest-Fake-Stories-2.png","width":1544,"height":1029,"duration":null}},"title":"6-Fakest-Fake-Stories-2.png","cropMode":"TOP","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":true,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":false},"restrictCropping":false,"id":"5a5f98dbdd94fc12188411ef","revision":2,"createdAt":"January 17, 2018 1:41 pm","modifiedAt":"January 17, 2018 3:37 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"January 17, 2018 3:37 pm","credit":"Photo Illustration by Jordan Amchin; From clockwise, by Olivier Douliery/Bloomberg/Getty Images, by David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images, by Olivier Douliery/Pool/Bloomberg, by Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images, by Al Drago/Bloomberg/Getty Images, by Luke Sharrett/Bloomberg/Getty Images.","tags":[],"altText":"","description":"From clockwise: Getty; 905930480, 860273932, 905692798, 513713210, 905930930, 891290484","modelName":"photo","collection":"photos"}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Maya Kosoff","name":"Maya Kosoff","bio":"Maya Kosoff writes about tech for VF.com.

After one such exchange, MSNBC host <strong>Chris Hayes</strong> even <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2017/10/31/16580626/carter-page-chris-hayes-russia-trump\">expressed</a> concern for the self-styled “Russian energy expert”: “I genuinely hope, Carter, that you’re innocent of everything, because you’re doing a lot of talking,” he said. “It’s either admirably bold or reckless, but I guess we’ll find out.”</p>\n<p>All of which makes Monday’s news surprising: according to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/29/carter-page-fbi-surveillance-374131\">Politico</a>, Page declined to comment on a <em>New York Times</em> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/01/donald-trump-andrew-mccabe-rod-rosenstein-russia\">report</a> alleging that the classified memo compiled by Congressman <strong>Devin Nunes’s</strong> office reveals that Deputy Attorney General <strong>Rod Rosenstein</strong> improperly approved an application to extend surveillance of Page last spring. “I’m still awaiting the facts,” Page told the outlet via text, adding that he’s waiting for a response to his Freedom of Information Act request seeking information on any F.B.I. surveillance involving him in 2016 and after. When pressed, Page told Politico, “U.S.-Russia relations has been dominated by misunderstandings throughout much of the past 70 years since the original McCarthy era,” and added, “I harbor no ill will towards anyone for past xenophobic biases and only hope that justice is eventually served.”</p>\n<p>Page’s uncharacteristic restraint may be tested on Monday night, when the House Intelligence Committee is <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/fbi-scrambling-to-get-more-info-on-explosive-nunes-memo-ahead-of-vote-to-release-it\">expected to vote</a> on declassifying the controversial Nunes memo, which allegedly proves that F.B.I. and D.O.J. officials sought to conceal the extent to which their surveillance of Page was influenced by the infamous Steele dossier (a document that Page himself has dubbed the “dodgy” dossier). That said, U.S. law enforcement’s interest in Page dates back to 2013, when Russian operatives sought to recruit him as a spy. The bureau never accused Page of wrongdoing, but according to F.B.I. documents, the Russians thought Page was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/us/politics/carter-page-trump-russia.html\">“an idiot.”</a></p>\n<p>Ex-press secretary <strong>Sean Spicer</strong> offered up a similar characterization of Page during an interview with MSNBC on Monday. When asked whether he believed that Page was acting as a Russian agent during the 2016 election, Spicer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/frreigns/status/958061854496116736\">replied</a>, “I don’t think Carter Page acted as anything but a clown.”</p>","channel":"News","subChannel":"Politics","tags":["carter page","donald trump","russia","investigation","robert mueller","devin nunes","memo","congress"],"ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"dek":"The ex-Trump adviser either got a good lawyer or some common sense.","seoTitle":"Carter Page Finally Realizes He’d Better Stop Talking","seoDescription":"The ex-Trump adviser either got a good lawyer or some common sense.","socialTitle":"Carter Page Finally Realizes He’d Better Stop Talking","socialDescription":"The ex-Trump adviser either got a good lawyer or some common sense.","issueDate":"","rubric":"Mueller Investigation","promoHed":"Carter Page Finally Realizes He’d Better Stop Talking","promoDek":"The ex-Trump adviser either got a good lawyer or some common sense.","id":"5a6fa9ebf7749464647f9775","revision":19,"createdAt":"January 29, 2018 6:10 pm","modifiedAt":"January 30, 2018 10:33 am","revisionCreatedAt":"January 30, 2018 10:33 am","_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Abby Tracy","filename":"Carter-Page-Quiets.jpg","aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1446,"height":964,"format":"JPEG","duration":null,"url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2018/01/29/5a6faa13f7749464647f9776_Carter-Page-Quiets.jpg"},"3:2":{"override":false,"height":964,"width":1446,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":964,"width":1446,"x":0,"y":0}},"duration":null},"5:3":{"override":false,"height":867,"width":1445,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":867,"width":1445,"x":0.5,"y":0}},"duration":null},"2:3":{"override":false,"height":963,"width":642,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":963,"width":642,"x":402,"y":0}},"duration":null},"9:16":{"override":false,"height":960,"width":540,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":960,"width":540,"x":453,"y":0}},"duration":null},"7:3":{"override":false,"height":618,"width":1442,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":618,"width":1442,"x":2,"y":0}},"duration":null},"16:9":{"override":false,"height":810,"width":1440,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":810,"width":1440,"x":3,"y":0}},"duration":null},"4:3":{"override":false,"height":963,"width":1284,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":963,"width":1284,"x":81,"y":0}},"duration":null},"1:1":{"override":false,"height":964,"width":964,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":964,"width":964,"x":241,"y":0}},"duration":null}},"title":"Trump Russia Probe","credit":"By J.

Everyone from Senate majority leader <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/11/roy-moore-mitch-mcconnell-alabama-senate-race\"><strong>Mitch McConnell</strong></a> to <strong>Ivanka Trump</strong> spoke out against Moore’s continued candidacy, with the latter <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/25/us/politics/trump-roy-moore-mcconnell-alabama-senate.html\">saying</a> in a statement that there was “a special place in hell for people who prey on children.” Even unwavering Trump ally <strong>Sean Hannity</strong> expressed his <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/11/republicans-call-on-roy-moore-to-drop-out\">doubts</a>. That moment of moral clarity didn’t last long: <strong>Donald Trump</strong> rebuked his own daughter by forcefully endorsing Moore. The Republican National Committee, which had stopped fund-raising for Moore, turned the money spigot back on. Meanwhile, the relentless conservative media campaign to cast doubt on Moore’s accusers seems to have worked: After an initial drop in the polls, Moore now looks to be running about neck-in-neck with Democrat <strong>Doug Jones,</strong> with <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/alabama-race-is-neck-and-neck-with-voters-divided-over-roy-moore-allegations-poll-finds/2017/12/01/32e659ec-d6bd-11e7-b62d-d9345ced896d_story.html?utm_term=.002db57a80cf\">fewer than 1 in 6</a> Republican-leaning voters saying they believe the allegations are true.</p>\n<p>The dramatic reversal recalls the aftermath of the October 2016 release of the <em>Access Hollywood</em> tape that many believed would torpedo Trump’s candidacy. And behind the scenes, the same man who encouraged Trump’s allies to stick by him has been working tirelessly to prop up Moore, whom he supported against establishment Republican candidate <strong>Luther Strange</strong>: erstwhile Trump adviser <strong>Steve Bannon.</strong> “He’s the counter to the ‘fake news’&#8212;he’s been a stalwart,” Moore told <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-11/how-steve-bannon-rescued-roy-moore-s-campaign-against-all-odds\">Bloomberg</a> of Bannon. “It’s helped us a lot. He’s the master strategist.”</p>\n<p>Though Bannon’s associates and allies recently <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/12/roy-moore-pedophile-alt-right-alabama-steve-bannon\">told me</a>, that they’re unhappy that their fortunes are yoked to Moore, Bannon’s public support has never wavered. Meanwhile, his private approach has reportedly been two-pronged: first, he worked to discredit the accusers and the press who reported on their claims; second, he launched an effort to win back conservative media figures. The first wasn’t exactly a stroke of strategic genius; right-wing pundits began to question the accusers’ accounts in almost the same beat as they were made public, and Trump, whose endorsement had the potential to make or break Moore among his powerful base, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/11/roy-moore-trump-republicans-288769\">privately questioned them</a> from the outset, reportedly complaining that the #metoo movement is spiraling out of control. But the second approach proved crucial in the aftermath of Hannity’s near-defection.</p>\n<p>After Hannity <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/11/15/sean-hannity-gave-roy-moore-an-ultimatum-then-he-went-soft/\">issued an ultimatum</a> on his show demanding Moore explain his actions “within 24 hours” or risk losing his support, Bannon <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-11/how-steve-bannon-rescued-roy-moore-s-campaign-against-all-odds\">reportedly</a> went into overdrive:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Along with Breitbart’s Washington editor, <strong>Matthew Boyle,</strong> he besieged the Fox News host with phone calls and texts. Bannon, who recently told <em>The New York Times</em> that Hannity is “the single most important voice for the ‘deplorables’”&#8212;his term for Trump supporters&#8212;asked the Fox host not to call on Moore to withdraw and instead to let Alabama voters decide, said people familiar with Bannon’s activities.\nOne of the people said Hannity was skeptical, but willing to listen. The person said Hannity texted Boyle, “You pull this off it’s a f--- miracle.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hannity did not offer comment on that particular text message, and through a spokesperson he denied to Bloomberg that he had been influenced by anyone. But he ultimately backed down on his ultimatum, saying that the voters of Alabama should decide for themselves whether to elect Moore to represent them. “I know these people,” he said the next day. “They’re smart, they’re great Americans&#8212;God, family, faith, country. I am very confident that when everything comes out, they will make the best decision for their state.” Hannity’s change of heart did not completely reverse Moore’s fortunes, but it did kick off a domino effect. The White House quickly cottoned on to the “let the voters decide” narrative, and eventually re-endorsed Moore as preferable to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/11/trump-endorses-accused-child-molester-roy-moore-over-liberal-person-doug-jones\">“liberal person”</a> Jones.

They’re like conjoined twins tied at the ego.</p>\n<p>The political world and social media remain convulsed&#8212;at least for another several hours, or light years in our Twitter-driven galaxy&#8212;by initial excerpts of Wolff&#39;s <em>Fire and Fury</em>, including far-fetched claims of “treason” leveled by onetime Trump consigliere <strong>Steve Bannon</strong>.</p>\n<p>As Axios’s <strong>Jonathan Swan</strong> noted, “The book’s quotes and claims are so sensational that barely any attention has been paid to some eye-popping quotes that Wolff attributes to former deputy chief of staff <strong>Katie Walsh</strong> [in the <em>New York</em> magazine excerpt he quoted her saying managing Trump is ‘like trying to figure out what a child wants.’] Katie told me she never said those things; and when I told that to Wolff&#39;s spokeswoman she said he stands by his reporting.’”</p>\n<p>Yes, pure Wolff. Provocative, discomfiting, and a bit ambiguous. Engrossing, yes. But true? Even folks inclined to lap it up struck obvious cautionary notes, as did CNN <em>New Day</em> co-host <strong>Alisyn Camerota</strong> this morning: “We should mention that it sounds like Michael Wolff’s modus operandi was to let the people he interviewed spin yarns. And  then he didn’t necessarily fact-check them. He didn’t necessarily need two sources. This isn’t really journalism. This is a very interesting read but in terms of the way he processed them he admits in the author&#39;s note that he let people tell their own stories and he printed them.”</p>\n<p>Wolff has long been a pretty big fish in the New York City media pond, laboring most notably for <em>New York</em> and <em>Vanity Fair</em> (of late it’s been mostly the <em>Hollywood Reporter</em>, <em>USA Today</em> and <em>The Guardian</em>). He’s way brighter than Trump&#8212;<strong>Josh Green</strong>, a Trump chronicler at Bloomberg, says what really angers Trump is the portrait of him as really stupid&#8212;but one who similarly cherishes the limelight and proximity to the rich and famous, even as he occasionally derided them with acidic and snarky prose (which some find wonderful).</p>\n<p>Thus, there was <strong>Maria Shriver’s</strong> “jaw planes, the cheekbone ridges. The porno-star hairdo.” <strong>Maureen Dowd’s</strong> alleged anger was explained by “her own women-who-love-too-much weakness.” He chided <strong>Rupert Murdoch’s</strong> personal life as out of control. And he did all with a style that some found mean but others alluring as he derided the same elites he loved chumming around with.</p>\n<p><strong>Michelle Cottle</strong>, now with <em>The Atlantic</em>, captured him in a 2003 <em>New Republic</em> <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/67746/wolff-trapped\">profile</a> (which she tells me she was hearing a lot about again yesterday), in part turning how “From the start, Wolff was adamant about being neither a media reporter (working the phones isn’t really his style) nor a media critic (‘that dour schoolmarm figure’). Instead, he put himself at the center of the story, giving readers a first-person glimpse of the inner workings of the media biz as it happened to, and all around, him.”</p>\n<p>“Uninterested in the working press, Wolff’s special focus (fixation, even) has always been on the power players&#8212;the moguls&#8212;most of whom he has relentlessly and repeatedly skewered, scraping away the sheen of power and money to reveal the warts, flab, and psychic scars plaguing that rarefied breed of (in Wolff’s view) super-wealthy narcissists who buy, run, and ruin media companies for the gratification of their insatiable egos.”</p>\n<p>As telling, she wrote, “Much to the annoyance of Wolff’s critics, the scenes in his columns aren’t recreated so much as created&#8212;springing from Wolff’s imagination rather than from actual knowledge of events. Even Wolff acknowledges that conventional reporting isn’t his bag. Rather, he absorbs the atmosphere and gossip swirling around him at cocktail parties, on the street, and especially during those long lunches at (a then-hot restaurant) Michael’s.”</p>\n<p>David Carr, the late <em>New York Times</em> media writer, noted back then how “Michael will say anything about anybody. He’s fearless in a way that people attribute to sociopathology but that I always thought was a business strategy.”</p>\n<p>When it comes to Trump, Wolff has seen himself as chronicler of a timid, chagrined press unable to deal with a president who fights back.</p>\n<p>“Certainly, the media, even the liberal-biased media, has with professional equanimity covered right-wing administrations before,” he wrote last year. “The vast economic transformation of the Reagan years were taken in relative media stride. If anything, the media went easy on <strong>George W. Bush</strong> during the Iraq war.”</p>\n<p>“No, it isn’t just politics that’s got the media in existential despair over Donald Trump. It’s attitude, it’s behavior, it’s language, it’s the rules of decorum, or the full-scale abandonment of those rules, that has left the media not only uncertain about its role, but quite thinking its role must be to defend propriety and resist whatever unfamiliar, louche, rude, and right-wing thing is to come.”</p>\n<p>When Rep. <strong>John Lewis</strong>, the Georgia Democrat and civil rights hero, announced he would not attend Trump’s inauguration, Trump derided him, in the same ways he always respond to slights, as was the case with his anti-Bannon tirade Wednesday. <em>New Yorker</em> Editor <strong>David Remnick</strong>, who had praised and defended Lewis, was chided by Wolff for “rushing to express horrified shock, if not total incomprehension” over Trump’s response. Wolff <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/columnist/wolff/2017/01/22/how-should-media-cover-donald-trump/96840686/\">belittled the magazine&#39;s approach to Trump</a>, scoffing at a press unprepared for Trump&#39;s reflexive disrespect.</p>\n<p>And now comes Wolff’s book that, if initial excerpts are reflective of the entirety, prove the ample reason for “horrified shock, if not total incomprehension,” over Trump’s tenure. Here’s a <em>Hollywood Reporter</em> <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/michael-wolff-my-insane-year-inside-trumps-white-house-1071504\">piece</a> by him on the effort. Of course, those who doubt Wolff’s accuracy may now herald his empirical discernment. Of course, too, it takes one to know one.</p>\n<p><strong>Breitbart News on Bannon-Trump</strong></p>\n<p>Well, if you looked in the hours after the great rhetorical conflagration, you got less Breitbart on Breitbart.com than you got that evil mainstream media. The most prominent stories were pretty straight, separate accounts of what <strong>Jake Tapper</strong> <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/video/2018/01/03/chuck-todd-trump-bannon-fallout-buried-steve-bannon-president/\">thought</a> on CNN and what <strong>Chuck Todd</strong> <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/video/2018/01/03/chuck-todd-trump-bannon-fallout-buried-steve-bannon-president/\">thought</a> on MSNBC. The wayward liberal media should ask Bannon &amp; Co. for royalties.</p>\n<p><strong>Sean Hannity on Bannon-Trump</strong></p>\n<p>Not relying on Tapper or Todd here!  It was all about the media being &quot;addicted to hating Trump,&quot; craving its next &quot;fix&quot; of Trump tweets and &quot;melting down&quot; and calling him nuts (cut to video of CNN&#39;s <strong>Brian Stelter</strong> and <strong>Jeffrey Toobin</strong>, among others, doing just that). Well, there was some of Tapper, too, come to think of it. Oh, we somehow had 23-year-old video of <strong>Bill Clinton</strong> on a nuclear deal with North Korea and talk of the alleged <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong>-related Russian uranium conspiracy that&#39;s been debunked even by his colleague <strong>Shepard Smith</strong>.</p>\n<p>As for the Trump rejoinder to Bannon, Hannity finally got around to the briefest of references to that feud after more than 11 minutes of his opening rope-a-dope monologue (for ideology, they really could use editing). &quot;They hate Bannon and they hate Trump...but they love these intramural fights&quot; (for some reason, Hannity keep looking to his right, as if ISIS recruits had just entered the studio).</p>\n<p>He didn&#39;t say much other than when one works for the president, one must show loyalty to him and the country. That was it. He turned to two bastions analytical neutrality, <strong>Sebastian Gorka</strong> and <strong>Mike Huckabee</strong>, to discuss &quot;the media&#39;s Trump addiction.&quot;</p>\n<p>Knock on wood for the alternative of the Cavaliers-Celtics on ESPN.</p>\n<p><strong>Spotify going public</strong></p>\n<p>Cheddar <a href=\"https://cheddar.com/videos/does-spotifys-direct-listing-count-as-an-ipo?utm_source=All+Subs&amp;utm_campaign=14ac0f0044-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2018_01_03&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_4b7ac66387-14ac0f0044-87302973\">spoke with</a> Axios reporter-editor <strong>Dan Primack</strong> on his exclusive about Snap deciding to go public and using a relatively unusual gambit called direct listing to do so. It won&#39;t be your average IPO.</p>\n<p><strong>Simple advice for media: Don&#39;t follow the U.S. Army</strong></p>\n<p>If looking for marketing counsel, media won&#39;t find much inspiration from the big-budget Pentagon. Says Adweek:</p>\n<p>&quot;The results of an internal audit of the U.S. Army’s budget question the effectiveness of the hundreds of millions in taxpayer dollars the organization spends on marketing and advertising each year. Its conclusions call many of these programs &#39;ineffective,&#39; claiming that the majority do not justify the costs.&quot;</p>\n<p>Documents indicated that &quot;The document goes on to claim that the AMRG (the Army&#39;s marketing and advertising program) spent more than $930.7 million from 2013 to 2016 &#39;on marketing efforts that potentially didn’t provide best value to support Army recruiting,&#39; noting that 20 different programs costing a collective $36.8 million in 2016 alone &#39;didn’t demonstrate a positive return.&#39; The summary continues, &#39;For [fiscal years 2018-2023], AMRG would continue to use about $220 million for the same ineffective marketing programs.&#39;&quot;</p>\n<p><strong>A different criminal justice story</strong></p>\n<p>From the terrific New Food Economy combines with <em>The Atlantic</em> for <a href=\"https://newfoodeconomy.org/prison-food-is-making-u-s-inmates-disproportionately-sick/\">this saga</a>: &quot;Lapses in food safety have made U.S. prisoners six times more likely to get a foodborne illness than the general population.&quot;</p>\n<p>Prison food safety has been touched upon before, including by the Marshall Project, the criminal justice operation overseen by <strong>Bill Keller</strong>, the former executive editor of The New York Times. This opus informs, &quot;New evidence suggests that the situation is worse than previously thought, and not just because prison food isn’t winning any <strong>James Beard</strong> awards. It’s also making inmates sick.&quot;</p>\n<p><strong>Morning Babel (Bannon &quot;excommunication&quot; edition&quot;)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Chris Cuomo</strong> argued on CNN&#39;s &quot;New Day&quot; that Bannon is trying to have it both ways, claiming to support the president but outing Donald Jr. The Daily Beast&#39;s John Avlon discerned a &quot;circular firing squad turning on itself.&quot; It was part and parcel of the counter-Fox narrative about &quot;a seedy soap opera,&quot; as analyst David Gregory put it.</p>\n<p>Later, Cuomo and Camarota did nice jobs in separately handling interviews with former White House communications aide <strong>Anthony Scaramucci</strong> and journalist-Trump chum <strong>Chris Ruddy</strong>, respectively.  One might wonder, though, about Cuomo&#39;s flat assertion about the Wolff book, &quot;If just half is true of everything, it is unlike any kind of dysfunction we have heard about in any organization at this level.&quot; Any?</p>\n<p>On MSNBC&#39;s <em>Morning Joe</em>, <strong>Joe Scarborough</strong> segued back to the Russia investigation and what he deems the &quot;pathetic attempt to attack the men and women of the FBI&quot; by Team Trump. Oh, no surprise he gets mentioned in the Michael Wolff book:</p>\n<p>&quot;On the Sunday after the immigration order was issued, Joe Scarborough and his Morning Joe co-host, <strong>Mika Brzezinski</strong>, arrived for lunch at the White House. Trump proudly showed them into the Oval Office. &#39;So how do you think the first week has gone?&#39; he asked the couple, in a buoyant mood, seeking flattery. When Scarborough ventured his opinion that the immigration order might have been handled better, Trump turned defensive and derisive, plunging into a long monologue about how well things had gone. &#39;I could have invited Hannity!&#39; he told Scarborough.&quot;</p>\n<p><strong>Will the next revolution be tweeted, not televised?</strong></p>\n<p>The Iranian protests have clearly employed social media. But is it just too facile to see social media as liberating technology? The answer is an obvious yes, with New York University expert <strong>Joshua Tucker</strong> explaining this this <em>U.S. News &amp; World Report</em> story the state of current research on the link between social media and protests. There&#39;s no small amount of ambiguity.</p>\n<p><strong>Facebook and the Palestineans</strong></p>\n<p>The Intercept&#39;s <strong>Glenn Greenwald</strong> <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/12/30/facebook-says-it-is-deleting-accounts-at-the-direction-of-the-u-s-and-israeli-governments/\">reports</a>, &quot;Facebook has been on a censorship rampage against Palestinian activists who protest the decades-long, illegal Israeli occupation, all directed and determined by Israeli officials. Indeed, Israeli officials have been publicly boasting about how obedient Facebook is when it comes to Israeli censorship orders.&quot;</p>\n<p><strong>Hoda Kotb&#39;s salary</strong></p>\n<p>There are lots of fat numbers thrown around for what the new co-host of <em>Today</em> earns and what <strong>Matt Lauer</strong> has been earning. Some suggest at least three-fold difference with Kotb somewhere in the $7 million a year range. But <em>Variety&#39;s</em> <strong>Brian Steinberg</strong> <a href=\"http://variety.com/2018/tv/news/hoda-kotb-salary-matt-lauer-today-nbc-1202652287/\">explains</a> the obvious realities of why that&#39;s true but why it may well not stay true.</p>\n<p>&quot;While the optics of the financial arrangement have spurred a very worthwhile and necessary discussion about compensation parity among men and women in the media business, the simple fact is that Kotb is being treated much like almost any other anchor or host who takes over a coveted and long-held post on a venerable TV program. TV networks often see opportunity in such transitions, because it typically means a cutback in salary outlay.&quot;</p>\n<p><strong>And, finally, there&#39;s Jim Risen</strong></p>\n<p>It would be nice if the Washington press might spend a few minutes putting aside the Michael Wolff excerpts and instead read Pulitzer Prize winning former New York Times reporter <strong>James Risen&#39;s</strong> understated and compelling <em>cri de coeur</em> in The Intercept, &quot;<a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/01/03/my-life-as-a-new-york-times-reporter-in-the-shadow-of-the-war-on-terror/\">The Biggest Secret: My Life as a New York Times Reporter in the Shadow of the War on Terror</a>.&quot;</p>\n<p>It&#39;s a remarkable account of his successes but mostly his struggles with both two different White House administrations and his own paper&#39;s editors. It&#39;s a primer on the importance, delicacy and perils of the most serious national security reporting and how easy it is for government to squelch reporting. It is, too, an admission of his own occasional stridency when it came to trying to get stories published and fighting his own superiors. It&#39;s really long but two key thoughts near the end:</p>\n<p>&quot;I believe my willingness to fight the government for seven years may make prosecutors less eager to force other reporters to testify about their sources. At the same time, the Obama administration used my case to destroy the legal underpinnings of the reporter’s privilege in the 4th Circuit, which means that if the government does decide to go after more reporters, those reporters will have fewer legal protections in Virginia and Maryland, home to the Pentagon, the CIA, and the NSA, and thus the jurisdiction where many national security leak investigations will be conducted. That will make it easier for Donald Trump and the presidents who come after him to conduct an even more draconian assault on press freedom in the United States.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;The battles over national security reporting in the years after 9/11 have yielded mixed results. In my view, the mainstream media has missed some key lessons from the debacle over WMD reporting before the war in Iraq. Times reporter Judy Miller became an easy scapegoat, perhaps because she was a woman in the male-dominated field of national security reporting. Focusing on her made it easier for everyone to forget how widespread the flawed pre-war reporting really was at almost every major media outlet. &#39;They wanted a convenient target, someone to blame,&#39; Miller told me recently. The anti-female bias &#39;was part of it.&#39; She notes that one chapter in her 2015 memoir, &#39;The Story: A Reporter’s Journey,&#39; is titled &#39;Scapegoat.&#39;&quot;</p>\n<p>This is all alternately inspiring and discouraging. But no Washington reporting in the past decade was as important as what Risen, and a few others, sought to do. In an age where being provocative and &quot;interesting&quot; can be a media priority and bring fame, this is a profile of important but potentially perilous and admirable heavy lifting. It&#39;s what journalism is really about. Check it out.</p>\n<p>Corrections? Tips? Please email me: jwarren@poynter.org. Would you like to get this roundup emailed to you every morning?

Him Feel Like Less of a “Lone Gunslinger”","body":"<p><strong>Willem Dafoe</strong> is an awards-season expert&#8212;kinda. The actor received his third Oscar nomination for <em>The Florida Project</em> this year and has a film career that stretches back to the mid-80s, when he received his first best-supporting-actor nod for <em>Platoon.</em> But according to Dafoe, the awards season we know now is wildly different from the one he first encountered as a 31-year-old stage actor.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t even know when the announcements were made, I really didn’t,” he tells <strong>Mike Hogan</strong> on this week’s episode of <em>Little Gold Men.</em> “I didn’t have a publicist, I didn’t know what it meant. I knew it was an honor. So there was an innocence a lot, at least a lot for me.”</p>\n<p>A lot has changed, for awards season and Dafoe alike, in the 31 years since <em>Platoon.</em> But <em>The Florida Project</em> was, in a way, a chance for Dafoe to return to his roots with the downtown theater company the Wooster Group. Filming at a real rundown motel in Florida, Dafoe had the opportunity to bond with his co-stars&#8212;many of whom, like <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/10/the-florida-project-bria-vinaite-sean-baker-drake-toronto\">star <strong>Bria Vinaite,</strong></a> were acting in their first film. And though there was a script, from director <strong>Sean Baker</strong> and co-writer <strong>Chris Bergoch,</strong> there was also ample opportunity to improvise lines or entirely new scenes. Like, say, the flock of long-necked birds who showed up in the motel’s parking lot one day. “There’s some birds outside,“ Dafoe says, taking on the voice of Baker. “We wanna get ’em off the parking lot. Willem, get ’em off the parking lot.”</p>\n<p>Dafoe has earned a slew of awards nominations and wins for the role, which means enduring the long and sometimes exhausting process of awards season. But it’s something he says he values as a chance to catch up with his industry, especially since he lives primarily in Rome and New York. “My sense of community is a little slippery. When I do get in these kind of industry things, it’s fun for me, because I feel a part of the industry. I feel a little more connected to this world. I don’t feel like a lone gunslinger like I do sometimes when I’m making a film with <strong>Theo Angelopoulos</strong> in Eastern Europe, or making a down-and-dirty film with <strong>Abel [Ferrara]</strong> in Rome. I’m engaged, I’m not complaining. But my sense of the world is very specific to those circumstances, and I don’t feel a connection to a bigger world or an industry. But when I get in this kind of context, it feels good.”</p>\n<p>Living outside of Los Angeles, though, doesn’t keep him from comparing himself to other actors once in a while, at least when it comes to publicity. “Sometimes you go on talk shows and they have you do goofy skits and I think, well, would <strong>Daniel Day-Lewis</strong> do this? I don’t know. But I know I’m good with it.”</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row iframe\"><div class=\"wrapper\"><div class=\"embed iframe-embed-component \" data-type=\"iframe\" data-url=\"https://player.megaphone.fm/PPY5594365366?\"><iframe height=\"150\" width=\"450\" src=\"https://player.megaphone.fm/PPY5594365366?\"></iframe></div></div></div><p>You can listen to the interview with Willem Dafoe and the rest of this week’s <em>Little Gold Men</em> embedded above; the episode also includes discussion of the buzz around <em>Black Panther,</em> a recap of the Sundance Film Festival, and some pondering on the continually slippery state of the best-picture race.</p>\n<p>Visit <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/little-gold-men/id1042433465?mt=2\">Apple Podcasts</a> to subscribe to <em>Little Gold Men</em> and leave a review.</p>","channel":"Hollywood","subChannel":"Movies","tags":["little gold men","awards"],"ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"dek":"The <em>Florida Project</em> star joins the <em>Little Gold Men</em> podcast to talk about improvising with birds, and what he’ll do that Daniel Day-Lewis probably wouldn’t.","seoTitle":"Willem Dafoe Says Awards Season Makes Him Feel Like Less of a “Lone Gunslinger”","seoDescription":"The Florida Project star joins the Little Gold Men podcast to talk about improvising with birds, and what he’ll do that Daniel Day-Lewis probably wouldn’t.","socialTitle":"Willem Dafoe Says Awards Season Makes Him Feel Like Less of a “Lone Gunslinger”","socialDescription":"The Florida Project star joins the Little Gold Men podcast to talk about improvising with birds, and what he’ll do that Daniel Day-Lewis probably wouldn’t.","issueDate":"","rubric":"Little Gold Men","promoHed":"Willem Dafoe Says Awards Season Makes Him Feel Like Less of a “Lone Gunslinger”","promoDek":"The <em>Florida Project</em> star joins the <em>Little Gold Men</em> podcast to talk about improvising with birds, and what he’ll do that Daniel Day-Lewis probably wouldn’t.","id":"5a74ce2c26dda50f6f01b6ff","revision":20,"createdAt":"February 2, 2018 3:46 pm","modifiedAt":"February 2, 2018 5:11 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"February 2, 2018 5:11 pm","_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Katherine Rich","filename":"Willem-Dafoe-LGM.jpg","aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1544,"height":1029,"format":"JPEG","duration":null,"url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2018/02/02/5a74d99b5e061e3f9fddd66a_Willem-Dafoe-LGM.jpg"},"3:2":{"override":false,"height":1028,"width":1542,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1028,"width":1542,"x":1,"y":0}},"duration":null},"5:3":{"override":false,"height":924,"width":1540,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":924,"width":1540,"x":2,"y":0}},"duration":null},"2:3":{"override":false,"height":1029,"width":686,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1029,"width":686,"x":429,"y":0}},"duration":null},"9:16":{"override":false,"height":1024,"width":576,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1024,"width":576,"x":484,"y":0}},"duration":null},"7:3":{"override":false,"height":660,"width":1540,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":660,"width":1540,"x":2,"y":0}},"duration":null},"16:9":{"override":false,"height":864,"width":1536,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":864,"width":1536,"x":4,"y":0}},"duration":null},"4:3":{"override":false,"height":1029,"width":1372,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1029,"width":1372,"x":86,"y":0}},"duration":null},"1:1":{"override":false,"height":1029,"width":1029,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1029,"width":1029,"x":257.5,"y":0}},"duration":null}},"title":"775110778AB00048_The_33rd_S","credit":"By Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images.","cropMode":"TOP","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":true,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":false},"restrictCropping":false,"id":"5a74d99b5e061e3f9fddd66b","revision":1,"createdAt":"February 2, 2018 4:35 pm","modifiedAt":"February 2, 2018 4:35 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"February 2, 2018 4:35 pm","tags":[],"altText":"775110778AB00048_The_33rd_S","description":"Getty; 913238756","modelName":"photo","collection":"photos"}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"name":"Vanity Fair","id":"53d70c86db4ec93c547cd568","revision":14,"createdAt":"July 28, 2014 10:52 pm","modifiedAt":"December 6, 2016 2:57 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"December 6, 2016 2:57 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"contributors","modelName":"contributor","publishable":true,"image":false,"identifiable":true,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":false},"bio":"<em>Vanity Fair</em> features in-depth reporting, gripping narratives, and world-class photography, plus heaping doses of Oscar-blogging, royal-watching, and assorted guilty pleasures.

It’s anti-patriarchy.”</p>\n<p>Bannon noted <strong>Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson’s</strong> rapt attention on <strong>Oprah</strong> during her Cecil B. DeMille Award <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/01/golden-globes-2018-oprah-winfrey-cecil-b-demille-acceptance-speech\">acceptance speech</a>. “He’s ruined his career,” Bannon said, according to Green. “If you rolled out a guillotine, they’d chop off every set of balls in the room.” He also ruled that Oprah, should she decide to get involved in the 2018 midterms, could pose a legitimate threat, ushering in a wave of activism that could assist Democrats in taking back the House of Representatives.</p>\n<p>&quot;You watch,” Bannon is quoted as saying. “The time has come. Women are gonna take charge of society. And they couldn’t juxtapose a better villain than Trump. He is the patriarch. This is a definitional moment in the culture. It’ll never be the same going forward . . . The anti-patriarchy movement is going to undo 10,000 years of recorded history.”</p>","channel":"Style","subChannel":"Celebrity","tags":["steve

Mike Cernovich Be Steve Bannon’s Mini-Me?","body":"<section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>The thing about the movement <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/04/alt-right-movement-evolution\">formerly known as the alt right</a>&#8212;a far-right subculture whose anarchic ideology is inseparable from the Internet&#8212;is that its inhabitants are, by and large, painfully, haltingly awkward. They could be neo-Nazis, gleeful that <strong>Donald Trump</strong> disparages immigrants and minorities; they could be Internet trolls who while away their evenings making anti-Semitic <a href=\"https://www.adl.org/education/references/hate-symbols/pepe-the-frog\">Pepe the Frog</a> memes in MS Paint. They could spend their time angrily fighting with Black Lives Matter on Twitter or flooding a woman’s DMs with rape threats that they’ve rebranded as jokes (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/23/alt-right-online-humor-as-a-weapon-facism\">irony</a>, after all, is a useful tool in the <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/daily-stormer-nazi-style-guide_us_5a2ece19e4b0ce3b344492f2\">proto-fascist playbook</a>). But for the most part, they’re computer-dependent outcasts who find social satisfaction in watching far-right celebrities rant on the Internet. With very few exceptions, many of the attendees at <strong>Mike Cernovich’s</strong> party last weekend would never have made it past the door on a normal Saturday at FREQ, a Hell’s Kitchen nightclub regularly reserved for electronica parties.</p>\n<p>But they did last Saturday night, courtesy of the man known as Cerno. The former club child and lifestyle guru, whose strident views on masculinity (and Pizza-gate) inadvertently led him into the Trump-era political-media complex, now commands a following of Internet trolls who excuse his conspiracy-minded leanings as long as he picks vicious Twitter fights with mainstream celebrities and journalists. And though the Night for Freedom party had been planned long before <em>Fire and Fury</em>’s release, Cernovich’s MAGA-sphere was all too eager to fill the power vacuum left by <strong>Steve Bannon.</strong> Seven hundred troll-army members showed up to do so; middle-aged libertarian intellectuals, dressed in suits and spangled dresses, mingled with neckbeards in uncomfortable formal jackets; drunken Proud Boys screamed behind <strong>Gavin McInnes</strong> about the virtues of straight white men; and Gateway Pundit writer <strong>Lucian Wintrich’s</strong> spiffy metrosexual posse bitchily dished on people they considered traitors to the movement. <strong>Stefan Molyneux,</strong> the men’s-rights radio host, decided to come out for the bash&#8212;an event in itself, given his years as a recluse&#8212;and spent the entire evening being bombarded by the young white men who worship him. College Republicans were manning the door, and <strong>Michael Flynn Jr.,</strong> Twitter’s favorite conspiracy theorist, whose alleged misdeeds might have facilitated his father’s decision to cooperate with the <strong>Robert Mueller</strong> probe, stood in awe of the talent by the stage (surrounded by other far-right types who in turn stared in awe at him).</p>\n<div class=\"embed cneembed\"><div class=\"embed block cneembed\" data-url=\"//player.cnevids.com/script/video/5a3298792d1ca07002000005.js?muted=1\"></div></div><p>Sprinkled throughout the crowd were several paranoid, newly minted bitcoin millionaires who had been invited to party with the troll army for the first time. “There’s a lot of crypto here, people who are really influential and deep in the game,” said a middle-aged man standing next to the speakers, who refused to give me his name but offered his opinion that the financial industry is full of crooks. “This is about trolling the establishment and breaking it up,” he explained of the disparate crowd. “This is about triggering people, and social engineering, and stuff.”</p>\n<p>As the far-right D.J. duo Milk N Cooks spun 90s hits, punctuated by <strong>Jack Posobiec</strong> performing spoken-word poetry by Johnny Cash, Cernovich drifted around the periphery of the dance floor, wearing a pale gray suit, greeting guests, and anxiously keeping an eye out for anything that screamed MAGA&#8212;an errant Nazi, a pro-Trump hat, a schlubby T-shirt with a slogan. Perhaps aware that suits would serve as a social lubricant for his protégées, he enforced a dress code&#8212;cocktail attire or business wear. (Coat check was required.) No one was allowed to get belligerent, and the guests, who had paid up to $300 to attend, got three free drinks with their tickets. (The sponsors, largely said bitcoin millionaires, had access to an open bar, and it showed.) There would be NO fighting&#8212;armed goons hired from <strong>Bo Dietl’s</strong> security firm would see to that&#8212;and as little drama as possible. A friend of Cernovich’s who owns a security firm volunteered background checks on attendees’ e-mails, even employing facial-recognition software to weed out uninvited members of the press or Antifa protesters.</p>\n<p>Before he became involved in the strange Internet world of MAGA, Cernovich told me, he was a party animal, constantly raging in nightclubs in Cabo and Vegas&#8212;a pursuit that would seemingly have bewildered the majority of A Night for Freedom guests. The event brought to mind a tame high-school prom, had that prom been populated by men’s-rights activists, cryptocurrency anarcho-capitalists, and <em>Gorilla Mindset</em> fanboys, and featured intense drunken jeering against identity politics, liberalism, and select members of the Fake News Media (whom Cernovich, in all his calculated generosity, had invited as well). The night’s only hiccup occurred when a BuzzFeed News reporter spotted recently announced Maryland Senate candidate <strong>Chelsea Manning.</strong> The N.S.A. whistleblower was hovering at the party’s edges having a drink, trying to remain off the record, and quietly talking to Internet provocateur <strong>Cassandra Fairbanks,</strong> a former liberal who’d drifted to the right. Her appearance, tweeted out by <strong>Charlie Warzel,</strong> led to a heated online debate over whether she was attending as a guest, or whether she’d crashed the event and was trying to cover her tracks.</p>\n<p>Manning and her liberal supporters <a href=\"https://twitter.com/xychelsea/status/954931315526299648\">insisted that she’d crashed</a>, with one <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VicBergerIV/status/955233863336452097\">pointing to McInnes’s speech mocking trans people</a> as proof that she’d never go to something like this. But two people in Cernovich’s camp told me that Manning <em>had</em> willingly showed up, and, weirdly enough, had been welcomed. “I just need a picture that will show what it was like,” Posobiec said later. “Just to show everyone that yes, she was here, and yes, everything was fine, and cool, and that was it. I didn’t even notice when she left. It was almost a non-event.” (<em>Never mind Manning,</em> many attendees insisted to me. The night’s major news was that a 56-year-old man had been assaulted by the handful of Antifa protesters who’d shown up outside the club, beaten severely enough that he was sent to the hospital, and why wasn’t anyone covering that?)</p>\n<p>After a year that included Charlottesville and the near election of <strong>Roy Moore,</strong> the event seemed designed to be as inoffensive as possible, a bonding experience that swept the national turmoil&#8212;and their own role in bringing it about&#8212;under the rug. Fringe freaks having a normal night in New York City: that was the weirdest part.</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>Cernovich’s party could not have come at a more complicated time. The far right is still reeling from a string of high-profile failures. Weeks earlier, Steve Bannon, their most high-profile ambassador to mainstream America, had been branded a traitor by Trump and drummed out of Breitbart by its shareholders. (It didn’t matter, several people at the party thought; Breitbart wasn’t that relevant to them anyway.) Prior to that, <strong>Milo Yiannopoulos,</strong> its culture-war <em>enfant terrible,</em> had crashed in a spectacular fashion: he’d been dismissed from mainstream consideration for his jokes about pedophilia, then scorned by the far right after his much-hyped Free Speech Week, his own attempt at a nationalist bacchanalia, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/09/milo-yiannopouloss-berkeley-fyre-festival-for-the-right\">failed miserably</a>.</p>\n<p>Absent Bannon and his protégé, Cernovich was the last person on the right with the influence to pull off a convocation of trolls. The reclusive Molyneux had only agreed to come, Cerno said, because he was the host; Wintrich, <strong>Ali Akbar,</strong> Posobiec, and the rest had all eagerly followed him to New York, hoping to score a speaking slot. But when the venues he’d booked began to pull out less than two days before the party, his own reputation was thrown into limbo. It was one thing for his foray into mainstream media, bolstered by the takedown of <strong>John Conyers,</strong> to die after he promoted a document falsely accusing <strong>Chuck Schumer</strong> of sexual harassment. It would be another if he let down 700 people, many of whom had traveled across the country to attend, and embarrassed himself in the eyes of the far right. “If he couldn’t find a venue, he could have scored a political victory and held a happy hour,” said Akbar, one of the speakers at the event. “But he wanted a cultural victory.”</p>\n<div class=\"callout omfg\" data-type=\"callout\"></div><p>When the first venue canceled one day before the party, Cernovich immediately pulled out his phone and began <a href=\"https://www.pscp.tv/w/1mnxerRlVlQKX\">streaming</a> his furious walk down the halls of Jack Studios in Chelsea, toting his infant daughter and venting to his fan base about how he was “set up” and the owners were suppressing his speech. But underneath the facade, he was terrified. After the stream ended and he left Jack Studios, trailed by a documentary crew from <em>The Atlantic,</em> he stumbled onto the pavement and began dry heaving.</p>\n<p>When the second venue canceled the next morning, a desperate Cernovich called in every single favor he could muster to find some venue, <em>any</em> venue, to make the event happen. His crew delivered. Akbar told me that he’d called “every rich Republican woman in Manhattan,” while Posobiec tried shaking down his contacts to get to the far right’s own prince and Manhattan real-estate mogul, <strong>Donald Trump Jr.</strong> (he never heard back). The caterers, whom he’d already paid $45,000, kept calling him from Long Island, asking exactly <em>where</em> the party would be. “Just start driving towards the city,” Cernovich recalled saying to them. In the end, it took <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Cernovich/status/954891059888316416\">$20,000 in cash</a>, which Cernovich withdrew from a Wells Fargo account and delivered to the owners of FREQ, a camera crew filming him the entire time.</p>\n<p>“Everyone wanted me to fail. And that’s why failure wasn’t an option,” Cernovich told me later, referring to the mob of journalists and Internet foes who laughed at his travails as they unfolded. “If this event hadn’t happened, it would have destroyed&#8212;people would have understood and forgave me, but I don’t want people to understand and forgive me. I want people to know that if I’m gonna show up and make something happen, we’re going to make it happen. I don’t want forgiveness.”</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>While the far right celebrated its Night for Freedom, more profound questions loomed over Cernovich and his compatriots regarding the future of the movement. With Bannon in the White House, and then back at Breitbart, the Internet’s far-right misfits had a sense of organization, marching orders, and, most important, a vision for their political ascendance in the Trump era. Now, they are once again searching for meaning, and leadership, on the periphery of power. At one point last year, Cernovich had <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/10/mike-cernovich-trump-pac\">planned to launch a super PAC</a>, along with two of his close allies, <strong>Jeff Giesea</strong> and Posobiec, to channel the energy of his online fan-base into a real-world political organization. Trump, after all, had elevated their station. Two months later, they <a href=\"https://www.mediaite.com/online/super-pac-created-by-maga-trolls-to-oust-moderate-republicans-shuts-down-after-two-months/\">shut it down</a>, writing in a statement that they were too busy with other projects to see it through. On Saturday night, MAGAworld settled for a bar mitzvah, instead.</p>\n<p>“Mike&#39;s branding&#8212;and his on and off attempt to pivot into mainstream respectability&#8212;depend on regular doses of media attention,” explained <strong>Will Sommer,</strong> the campaign editor for <em>The Hill</em> and the author of the <a href=\"https://tinyletter.com/rightrichter\">Right Richter newsletter</a>, noting some of Cernovich’s recent setbacks. “The problem is that, judging by the event&#39;s speeches, plenty of the leading New Right personalities aren&#39;t ready for Fox News, much less the mainstream media. Flanked by Proud Boys, Gavin McInnes went on his vile rant against trans people. Mike himself kept recurring to his obsession with supposed global pedophile networks&#8212;not exactly the stuff that gets the party going!”</p>\n<p>Cernovich himself was more upbeat, as were many of the party’s attendees.  As he was about to fly back to California, Cernovich told me that his “proof of concept” had worked; that there was a demand for these events, and that he and his silent partner had even more ambitious plans. His next party will be in D.C., on the same day as Reaganpalooza, CPAC’s hottest after-party hosted by college-aged right-wing activists. Or, as Cernovich called it, “the most boring party.”</p>\n<p>“Not everybody is a party boy or was a party boy like I was,” he conceded. “But that’s the idea. I want people to know we throw real parties.

Snag","body":"<p>Since 2016, when his two-year ban on managing other people’s money went into effect, hedge-fund manager <strong>Steve Cohen</strong> has been <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/05/steve-cohn-20-billion-dollar-comeback\">planning his “I’ll show you!” comeback</a>. In order to ensure that nothing overshadowed his big day, Cohen took a number of precautionary measures. For starters, he changed the name of his firm&#8212;the one that pleaded guilty to insider trading in 2013 and paid $1.8 billion in fines&#8212; from S.A.C. Capital Advisors (his initials), to Point72 Asset Management. He cleaned house, <a href=\"https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/a-top-lieutenant-of-steven-cohen-departs/\">replacing virtually all of the senior executives who were at the firm prior to 2013</a> with fresh ones. He started Point72 Academy, <a href=\"https://dealbreaker.com/2015/10/point72-academy-is-a-real-thing-that-exists/\">a finishing school for aspiring traders</a> who are taught that no amount of profit is worth breaking the law. He hired people who <a href=\"https://dealbreaker.com/2016/02/executive-of-multi-billion-dollar-hedge-fund-troubled-by-people-who-appear-motivated-by-money/\">say things</a> to the press like, “If somebody is coming here because they think it’s a way to make a lot of money early and retire in their thirties, they’re thinking about it wrong.” He <a href=\"https://dealbreaker.com/2016/01/sac-capital-makeover/\">gave staff input on interior design choices</a>. He started <a href=\"https://dealbreaker.com/2016/01/sac-capital-makeover/\">a lending library</a>. He stopped asking people “<a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2010/02/steve_cohen.html\">Do you even know how to do this f---ing job</a>?” And he screamed at people for losing money <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2016/01/11/the-second-coming-of-steven-cohen.html\">a lot less than he used to</a>. Unfortunately, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/12/business/steven-cohen-point72-discrimination-lauren-bonner.html\">according to a new lawsuit</a>, there was one ‘i’ he forgot to dot: the one in which women are (allegedly!) subjected to harassment and discrimination.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://assets.bwbx.io/documents/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/rp1z7cYaYs6Y/v0\">a lawsuit filed on Monday</a>, <strong>Lauren Bonner,</strong> an associate director at Point72, alleges, among other things, that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>For a number of weeks last year, a whiteboard belonging to a high-level Point72 executive had the word “pussy” written on it, “leaving the firm’s few senior women feeling uneasy, according to the lawsuit.”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Male colleagues routinely “[made] comments on women’s physical appearances.”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Women were regularly “denied promotions and regularly forced out after male executives accuse them of being ‘too emotional,’ ‘too sensitive,’ or simply, ‘women.’”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>After filing a complaint against a high-ranking male executive, said executive was still allowed to sit in on the promotion committee to decide if she would be named a director.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Another high-level executive called female employees “sweethearts” and “girls” and held “no girls allowed” meetings.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A recent hire who was “unequivocally less experienced and less qualified” than Bonner was brought on at a higher level and more than double the base salary.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>At a fundraiser last year, a company consultant asked another guy, regarding a woman to whom he’d been introduced, “Do you want to fuck her? You can. She works for me.”</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To the outside world, these allegations likely&#8212;and understandably!&#8212;come off as gross and shocking, but they didn’t exactly surprise some people who have worked on Wall Street. One person familiar with the workings of S.A.C., Cohen’s old shop, told me they were “surprised we haven’t seen more of these suits.” This person added that the previous firm’s culture was “a boy’s club, where you have young boys being paid lots of money, and creepy things are said all the time. [When I was there] guys were going to strip clubs after work and coming in the next day talking about f---ing hookers.” (A spokesperson for Point 72 declined to comment on these claims.)</p>\n<p>According to this person, however, while the atmosphere was misogynistic, it was <em>inclusive</em> misogyny: women ”were included if they could hang&#8212;if they didn’t make a big deal of it.” The situation, they said, “isn’t just a [S.A.C.] thing&#8212;it’s a much broader thing across Wall Street.” Another person familiar with the firm that I spoke to said that he was “surprised [by the news], given all the window dressing and all the lip service&#8212;the changing of the name, the academy&#8212;to create the opposite impression.” (In a statement to the Hive, Point72 said: “The firm emphatically denies these allegations and will defend itself in a more appropriate venue than the media.” It added: “We stand by our record of hiring and developing women. In an industry where women are historically underrepresented, the hundreds of women at Point72 are vital members of every part of our organization.”)</p>\n<p>Incidentally, back in the pre-financial-crisis days, S.A.C. Capital was <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/doc/23662651/Andrew-Tong-Filing\">sued</a> by a former employee, <strong>Andrew Tong,</strong> who alleged that before he was terminated, his boss, <strong>Ping Jiang,</strong> made him take female hormone pills and wear dresses and high heels as part of a “training program” designed to build “the ideal Analyst/Trader” by combining “the skills of a man” with “certain traits of a woman.” (Lawyers for S.A.C. and Jiang <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2007/10/12/two-in-the-sac/\">called</a> the allegations “salacious and false,” and <a href=\"http://www.institutionalinvestorsalpha.com/Article/2728302/Blogs-From-the-archives/Looking-back-at-former-SAC-trader-Ping-Jiang-and-Banyons-failed-Scott-Rothstein-investment.html\">the suit was later dropped</a>.) Of <em>that</em> situation, which allegedly involved Jiang making Tong give him blow jobs for trade approval, an employee of the firm <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2007/10/12/two-in-the-sac/\">told</a> the <em>New York Post,</em> “If taking female hormones actually helped you do your job, they would simply hire women here. But they don’t.”</p>\n<p><em><strong>If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, <a href=\"http://tinyletter.com/besslevin\">click here</a> to subscribe.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Louise Linton and Steve Mnuchin: A Love Story for the Ages</strong></p>\n<p>It’s difficult for us to pick our favorite part of <a href=\"http://www.elle.com/culture/career-politics/a15895367/louise-linton-march-2018/\">this glorious interview</a> the Treasury secretary’s wife sat for with <em>Elle</em> magazine, but a few include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The part where <strong>Steve Mnuchin</strong> says that there are so many sides to his wife the public doesn’t get to see, such as the side that “loves gadgets” (???):</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When asked about his wife’s turn in the spotlight over e-mail, just a few days after the horse poop incident, he wrote: “I think social media has made her misunderstood and she is not at all the person that has been portrayed. She has a huge heart, is sensitive, deeply compassionate, and kind. She has humility and gentleness. She’s also funny and makes people laugh. . . . She loves gadgets and has a bird feeder in the backyard. She reads John Stuart Mill and writes notes in the margins of her books. She’s an incredibly warm and loving person.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>The part where she says she <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/08/louise-linton-instagram\">flipped out on a stranger on the Internet</a> because she’s just a regular girl and that’s what regular girls do:</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>That Instagram comment has been playing on repeat in Linton’s mind for the last six months. “I think after being kicked and slapped on social media a billion times, I had this one time. This lady said I was a deplorable human being, and that hurt,” Linton says, her voice trembling in sincere horror and self-pity. Her hands are shaking. “So I had this knee-jerk reaction and I was like . . . <em>blarghhhh.</em> I was feeling like a regular person. And regular people, when someone says something mean to you on social media, regular people are allowed to respond.” It’s clear that she identifies much more strongly with a battered Dalmatian puppy than Cruella de Vil. “I felt like the kid on the playground that has been so bullied, and finally you punch back.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>And the part where she says we needn’t worry about the economy because the <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/steven-mnuchin-rex-tillerson-jim-mattis-suicide-pact-donald-trump-a7984151.html\">producer of <em>Suicide Squad</em></a> is on it:</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It’s easy to imagine that a couple, financially secure and happily working in the film industry in Los Angeles, would want to stay far away from the chaos of such a turbulent political operation. But Linton remembers it as a no-brainer. “It wasn’t a long deliberation because I think he felt incredibly honored to have the opportunity to serve the country. And I felt good because I know him so well, and I feel safe, knowing that the economy is in his hands.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Trump administration likens proposal to replace food stamps with boxes of canned goods to gourmet delivery service</strong></p>\n<p>For those of you who are unaware, Blue Apron is an ingredient-and-recipe meal-kit service that provides fresh ingredients like salmon, Dukkah seasoning, and gochujang to millennial yuppies so that they can “cook” dinner without having to go to the trouble of shopping for ingredients.

But, according to White House budget director <strong>Mick Mulvaney,</strong> who wants to replace food stamps with boxes of canned goods, the two programs are one and the same.</p>\n<p>“What we do is propose that for folks who are on food stamps, part&#8212;not all, part&#8212;of their benefits come in the actual sort of, and I don’t want to steal somebody&#39;s copyright, but a Blue Apron-type program where you actually receive the food instead of receive the cash,” Mulvaney <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/02/12/trump-wants-to-slash-food-stamps-and-replace-them-with-a-blue-apron-type-program/?utm_term=.a0d59136b362\">said</a> Monday. “It lowers the cost to us because we can buy [at wholesale prices] whereas they have to buy it at retail. It also makes sure they’re getting nutritious food. So we’re pretty excited about that.”</p>\n<p>There are a, incidentally, number of issues with this idea, aside from the fact that it’s not like Blue Apron, <em>at all</em>:</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/AnnieLowrey/status/963427645374517249\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/AnnieLowrey/status/963427645374517249\">https://twitter.com/AnnieLowrey/status/963427645374517249</a></p></blockquote></div><p><strong>Steve Bannon hearts Janet Yellen</strong></p>\n<p>“The Breitbart posse is in love with Janet Yellen,” the ex-adviser to the president reportedly <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-13/bannon-wanted-yellen-to-stay-fed-chair-calling-her-my-girl\">told</a> Bloomberg’s <strong>Joshua Green</strong> several months back. “Yellen’s my girl.” Sadly, his former boss <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/10/the-humiliation-of-gary-cohn-is-nearly-complete\">did not agree</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Elsewhere!</strong></p>\n<p>Tax cuts plus increased spending while economy is growing akin to throwing &#39;lighter fluid on a fire&#39;: <strong>Lloyd Blankfein</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/13/tax-cuts-like-throwing-lighter-fluid-on-a-fire-blankfein.html\">CNBC</a>)</p>\n<p>Volitility index manipulated to cost investors billions: whistleblower (<a href=\"https://nypost.com/2018/02/13/volitility-index-manipulated-to-cost-investors-billions-whistleblower/\">Reuters</a>)</p>\n<p>Twitter&#39;s CEO downplays chatter about possible acquisition (<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-twitter-m-a/twitters-ceo-downplays-chatter-about-possible-acquisition-idUSKCN1FX2VD\">Reuters</a>)</p>\n<p>Uber Sales Rose 61% to $2 Billion Last Quarter Under New C.E.O.

Bannon’s testimony has been highly anticipated following a series of scathing comments he made to author <strong>Michael Wolff,</strong> which precipitated his fall from favor. And although he was a late addition to Team Trump, the president’s former policy whisperer may still possess enough damning information to worry the White House and to intrigue special counsel <strong>Robert Mueller,</strong> who has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/16/us/politics/steve-bannon-mueller-russia-subpoena.html?_r=0\">reportedly</a> subpoenaed Bannon to testify before a grand jury.</p>\n<p><strong>Don Jr.’s “treasonous” Trump Tower meeting</strong></p>\n<p>Bannon will appear before the House Intelligence Committee on Tuesday, where he is all but assured to face scrutiny over his characterization of the infamous June 2016 Trump Tower meeting that <strong>Donald Trump Jr.</strong> orchestrated with a Russian lawyer, and which <strong>Jared Kushner</strong> and <strong>Paul Manafort</strong> attended as well. “The three senior guys in the campaign thought it was a good idea to meet with a foreign government inside Trump Tower in the conference room on the 25th floor&#8212;with no lawyers. They didn’t have any lawyers,” Bannon is quoted as saying in <em>Fire and Fury.</em> “Even if you thought that this was not treasonous, or unpatriotic, or bad shit, and I happen to think it’s all of that, you should have called the F.B.I. immediately.” Bannon reportedly speculated that the chance the eldest Trump son did not involve his father in the meeting “is zero.”</p>\n<p>When Bannon’s comments became public, Trump excoriated his former strategist, whom <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/01/bannon-don-jr-treasonous\">he accused of having “lost his mind.”</a> But while Bannon has since apologized for the remarks and sought to walk back a number of the quotes, he’s stopped short of denying that he viewed the Trump Tower meeting as treasonous. Instead, he’s merely shifted the blame away from Trump Jr. and onto Manafort. “My comments were aimed at Paul Manafort, a seasoned campaign professional with experience and knowledge of how the Russians operate. He should have known they are duplicitous, cunning, and not our friends. To reiterate, those comments were not aimed at Don Jr.,” Bannon said in <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/scoop-bannon-sends-regret-to-trump-1515329924-dbfe9439-59e0-4773-8d3d-079e5ee2b493.html\">a statement</a> to Axios. (Bannon has denied that the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government during the election.)</p>\n<p>Though the Trump Tower meeting took place before Bannon joined the Trump campaign, <strong>Adam Schiff,</strong> the ranking Democrat on the House panel, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/16/politics/steve-bannon-house-russia-investigation/index.html\">told CNN last week</a> that he plans to question Bannon about “why this meeting at Trump Tower represented his treason and certainly unpatriotic at a minimum.”</p>\n<p><strong>Jared Kushner’s “greasy shit”</strong></p>\n<p>Wolff also quotes the former White House strategist as saying, “This is all about money laundering. <strong>[Robert] Mueller</strong> chose [senior prosecutor <strong>Andrew] Weissmann</strong> first and he is a money-laundering guy. Their path to fucking Trump goes right through Paul Manafort, Don Jr., and Jared Kushner . . . It’s as plain as a hair on your face.” (Trump Jr., Kushner, and Manafort have all denied wrongdoing.) Bannon then zeroed in on Kushner specifically, adding that “[i]t goes through Deutsche Bank and all the Kushner shit. The Kushner shit is greasy. They’re going to go right through that. They’re going to roll those two guys up and say play me or trade me.”</p>\n<p>He and Trump’s son-in-law have never seen eye to eye; their White House feuds were a poorly kept secret, and following his ouster, Bannon has given numerous interviews knocking Kushner, including one to my colleague <strong>Gabriel Sherman</strong> in which he <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/12/bannon-for-president-trump-kushner-ivanka\">questioned</a> Kushner’s maturity level. If Bannon has dirt on Kushner, he will likely get his chance to reveal it; Schiff also <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/16/politics/steve-bannon-house-russia-investigation/index.html\">declared</a> his intent to question Bannon on “the basis of his concern over money laundering.”</p>\n<p><strong>Mike Flynn and WikiLeaks</strong></p>\n<p>Trump Tower meeting aside, there are a series of other critical moments during the Trump campaign, transition, and administration for which Bannon was present, ones that are likely of interest to congressional investigators. According to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/us/russia-mcfarland-flynn-trump-emails.html?_r=0\"><em>The New York Times,</em></a> Bannon was forwarded an e-mail from <strong>K. T. McFarland,</strong> who served as an adviser to the Trump transition, that detailed Mike Flynn’s plan to discuss the retaliatory election-related sanctions the Obama administration leveled against Moscow at the end of December 2016. In addition, <em>The Atlantic</em> <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/11/the-secret-correspondence-between-donald-trump-jr-and-wikileaks/545738/\">reported</a> that Bannon was among the senior officials Trump Jr. e-mailed in September 2016, informing them that WikiLeaks had made contact with him over Twitter.</p>\n<p><strong>Cambridge Analytica</strong></p>\n<p>Bannon’s relationship with <strong>Robert</strong> and <strong>Rebekah Mercer,</strong> who partly own the data analytics company used by the Trump campaign, Cambridge Analytica, is also likely to be of interest to the panel. In December, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/mueller-sought-emails-of-trump-campaign-data-firm-1513296899\">reported</a> that Cambridge Analytica had turned over e-mails from any employees who worked on the campaign to Mueller. And that same month, the company’s C.E.O., <strong>Alexander Nix,</strong> who <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/wikileaks-assange-says-he-rejected-overture-from-trump-linked-group-1508961298\">reportedly</a> contacted WikiLeaks founder <strong>Julian Assange,</strong> testified before the House Intelligence Committee via teleconference. (Nix has denied any wrongdoing.)</p>\n<p><strong>Erik Prince’s “backchannel”</strong></p>\n<p>The former Breitbart News chief also has close ties with <strong>Erik Prince,</strong> Blackwater founder and brother of Education Secretary <strong>Betsy DeVos.</strong>  In April, <em>The Washington Post</em> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/blackwater-founder-held-secret-seychelles-meeting-to-establish-trump-putin-back-channel/2017/04/03/95908a08-1648-11e7-ada0-1489b735b3a3_story.html\">reported</a> that Prince served as an unofficial envoy to the Trump campaign in a secret meeting brokered by the United Arab Emirates in early January 2017, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/04/erik-prince-blackwater-trump-russia\">in order to establish a backchannel</a> between Russian President <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong> and Trump. The meeting took place shortly after Kushner and Bannon met with the crown prince of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh <strong>Mohamed bin Zayed al-Nahyan,</strong> who arranged the meeting along with his brother. (Testifying before the House Intelligence Committee earlier this year, Prince denied that Bannon asked him to meet a Russian on behalf of Trump.)</p>","channel":"News","subChannel":"Politics","tags":["steve bannon","jared kushner","donald trump","trump tower","house intelligence

So they gave him a farewell honor, of sorts, by finally removing the grim reaper mask to reveal . . . <strong>Bill Murray</strong>??</p>\n<p>Outfitted in a “wrinkled barn jacket,” some lovingly applied facial splotches, and a truly luxurious wig, Murray popped up near the end of a <em>Morning Joe</em> sketch, sitting next to <strong>Michael Wolff</strong> (<strong>Fred Armisen</strong> in an eerily dead-on impression) to refute some of the claims made in Wolff’s new book <em>Fire and Fury.</em> “No one gets the Bannon fired,” Murray’s Bannon claimed. “I never said Don Jr. was treasonous.”</p>\n<p>“Yes you did,” Armisen’s Wolff responded.</p>\n<p>“Well, I certainly never said he cracked like an egg on TV.”</p>\n<p>“Yes you did, that sounds exactly like you.”</p>\n<p>“O.K. that does sound like me,” Murray’s Bannon concluded. “Thank you, good reporting.”</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/nbcsnl/status/952402779062067200/video/1\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/nbcsnl/status/952402779062067200/video/1\">https://twitter.com/nbcsnl/status/952402779062067200/video/1</a></p></blockquote></div><p>Bannon went on to detail all of his post-Breitbart plans, including a Crackle series called (<em>Cucks in Cars Getting Coffee,</em> a menswear line called Frumpers, and a skincare line called Blotch. He also claimed to be hard at work finding the next Trump-like unlikely political leader. “Logan Paul. Martin Shkreli. Jared the Subway guy. It’s time for America to slide down the Bannonster.” On that last line, Murray&#8212;a <em>Saturday Night Live</em> veteran famous for his deadpan&#8212;couldn’t resist cracking up.</p>\n<p>At this point nearly all of the most famous impressions of Trump administration members belong to superstars who aren’t in the regular <em>S.N.L.</em> cast&#8212; <strong>Alec Baldwin</strong> set the template as Trump (an impression no one thought would last beyond the election), then <strong>Melissa McCarthy</strong> ushered in the show’s period of hyper-relevance as <strong>Sean Spicer,</strong> the Emmy-winning impression that likely inadvertently sparked Spicer’s <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/09/colbert-emmys-sean-spicer-skit\">pop-culture comeback</a>. It seems likely that Murray only took the Bannon job, though, knowing that it would be a onetime thing. And it was a far more political appearance for Murray than the last time he returned to 30 Rock, showing up in October 2016 to celebrate the World Series victory of his beloved Chicago Cubs. But a lot has changed since the fall of 2016, after all. And when there’s a former White House employee best captured by a grim reaper mask, who better to send him off in splotchy style than Murray?</p>","channel":"Hollywood","subChannel":"Television","tags":["saturday night live","snl","bill murray","steve bannon"],"ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"dek":"So <em>that’s</em> who was under that grim reaper mask all along.","seoTitle":"Saturday Night Live Reveals Bill Murray as Their Steve Bannon","seoDescription":"So that’s who was under that grim reaper mask all along.","socialTitle":"Saturday Night Live Reveals Bill Murray as Their Steve Bannon","socialDescription":"So that’s who was under that grim reaper mask all along.","issueDate":"","rubric":"Live From New York","promoHed":"<em>Saturday Night Live</em> Reveals Bill Murray as Their Steve Bannon","promoDek":"So <em>that</em>’s who was under that grim reaper mask all along.","id":"5a5ae12b057a2c6758d78070","revision":15,"createdAt":"January 13, 2018 11:48 pm","modifiedAt":"January 16, 2018 12:08 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"January 16, 2018 12:08 pm","_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Katherine Rich","filename":"bill-murray-steve-bannon-snl.jpg","aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":690,"height":460,"format":"JPEG","duration":null,"url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2018/01/14/5a5ae2aa0ba3dc230ebe7670_bill-murray-steve-bannon-snl.jpg"},"3:2":{"override":false,"height":460,"width":690,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":460,"width":690,"x":0,"y":0}},"duration":null},"5:3":{"override":false,"height":414,"width":690,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":414,"width":690,"x":0,"y":0}},"duration":null},"2:3":{"override":false,"height":459,"width":306,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":459,"width":306,"x":192,"y":0}},"duration":null},"9:16":{"override":false,"height":448,"width":252,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":448,"width":252,"x":219,"y":0}},"duration":null},"7:3":{"override":false,"height":294,"width":686,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":294,"width":686,"x":2,"y":0}},"duration":null},"16:9":{"override":false,"height":387,"width":688,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":387,"width":688,"x":1,"y":0}},"duration":null},"4:3":{"override":false,"height":459,"width":612,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":459,"width":612,"x":39,"y":0}},"duration":null},"1:1":{"override":false,"height":460,"width":460,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":460,"width":460,"x":115,"y":0}},"duration":null}},"title":"bill-murray-steve-bannon-snl.jpg","cropMode":"TOP","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":true,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":false},"restrictCropping":false,"id":"5a5ae2aa0ba3dc230ebe7671","revision":0,"createdAt":"January 13, 2018 11:55 pm","modifiedAt":"January 13, 2018 11:55 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"January 13, 2018 11:55 pm","modelName":"photo","collection":"photos","altText":""}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"bio":"Katey Rich is the deputy editor of VanityFair.com.

Once the de facto headquarters of Breitbart’s legendary ragers, it had more recently become the decorous nerve center for Bannon’s attempt to do the D.C. power-player thing&#8212;fete Washingtonians with <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/08/trump-bannon-priebus-spicer-flynn-244667\">Dean &amp; DeLuca canapes</a> and hold them captive with his megalomania. But when Bannon stepped down from Breitbart earlier this week after he seemed unable to outrun the comments he had made about <strong>Donald Trump Jr.,</strong> among other things, in <strong>Michael Wolff’s</strong> book, he took its D.C. office in the divorce.</p>\n<p>Breitbart’s young writers and editors weren’t too fazed. They are, after all, a digital-savvy nomadic bunch, a group used to churning out copy regularly from wherever they can park a laptop and get a Wi-Fi signal. Many hadn’t even used the Embassy in a while. But there was something symbolic about having an office near the beating heart of power, where reporters huddled around a giant table, grinding away on their laptops, hoping to foment a political revolution. And then the heart of Breitbart disappeared.</p>\n<p>In the hours after the news broke of Bannon’s firing, the leadership of the site&#8212;including co-founder <strong>Larry Solov</strong> and editor-in-chief <strong>Alex Marlow</strong>&#8212;quickly instituted <em>omertà,</em> telling the writers not to talk to journalists outside the company. And with good reason: Breitbart needed to regroup. Bannon had become the face of the brand, to the point that the rest of the world could barely differentiate between him and the site itself. With Bannon gone, so was the site’s mission, in many people’s eyes. The leaders of several conservative publications <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/10/conservative-media-face-a-post-bannon-landscape-335799\">told Politico</a> that Bannon’s agenda had slowly eaten away at the late Andrew Breitbart’s fire-breathing conservative legacy over the years, leaving the site adrift. Everyone from <strong>Matt Drudge</strong> to Trump Jr. has called for the site to return to its roots and continue fighting the familiar culture wars of 2012-era America. And several figures in the Cult of Andrew agreed. “You can’t be a leader if it’s all about you. Andrew, he took care of people,” said <strong>Kurt Schlicter,</strong> a Breitbart acolyte who left the site over a falling-out with Bannon. “He would sit at a bar with a guy with a blog with five readers and talk to him for hours about it. You think Steve Bannon would let a guy with five blog followers in the same room with him?” (Representatives for Breitbart and Bannon did not respond to requests for comment.)</p>\n<p>But restoring Breitbart to its insurgent roots is easier said than done. To start with, it’s hard to wage an insurgency when the insurgents’ candidate is in the Oval Office. And though Bannon’s political aspirations certainly affected the site, he and Andrew Breitbart were much more similar than some are now suggesting: charismatic bomb-throwers, giving zero fucks, aggrieving liberal snowflakes with a steady diet of stories on black crime and Muslim interlopers. The current generation, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/16/magazine/breitbart-alt-right-steve-bannon.html?_r=0\">in comparison</a>, occasionally seems lost as it tries to reason through its position in a world with Trump in the White House and its leaders gone. Breitbart now consists of a suite of rented offices in Los Angeles, a Slack channel, and several dozen slightly bewildered millennials with the expectations of the far right weighing heavily on them.</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>After Andrew Breitbart died, lower-level employees immediately grabbed for better titles and more power. This time around, though, anyone looking for a right-wing <em>Game of Thrones</em> power struggle will leave sorely disappointed. After Bannon’s ouster, it became instantly clear that Marlow was in charge. His ascendancy post-Bannon was essentially secured after <strong>Matt Drudge</strong> published a tweet calling Marlow, Andrew Breitbart’s first hire, his intellectual heir. “[It’s a] 99 percent surety that Marlow consolidates power,” said a source close to the company. Solov, a low-key Californian averse to confrontation, would continue to run operations. Considering the personalities within Breitbart, that’s a smooth transition: despite his outsize Hill reputation as a loose cannon unnervingly loyal to Bannon, multiple sources in the company told me that political editor <strong>Matt Boyle</strong> was uninterested in making power plays, preferring to continue chasing cucks down the halls of Washington than providing a grand strategic direction for a site dedicated to tearing down liberal culture.</p>\n<p>And that, says the right-wing consensus, is the problem. No one would confuse the 31-year-old Marlow, generally respected in the community and within Breitbart, with Bannon, who had more enemies on the right than journalist supplicants in the mainstream media. “I thought Alex was a decent human being who was smart,” said <strong>Kurt Bardella,</strong> the site’s former spokesman, who had worked with Marlow and Solov for years. “He felt that he had a responsibility to the memory of Andrew to be there and guide the site, and had a lot of heartburn over the way that Steve really hijacked Breitbart.” That takeover included the leadership, too: numerous current and former employees told me that Bannon, whom Bardella described as a “dictatorial bully,” ran roughshod over Marlow and Solov during meetings, overruling their journalistic decisions through pure rage. Over the years, the two Breitbart veterans essentially gave up on pushing back. “[Marlow] was just beat down to where there was no point fighting with Steve because it’s never going to go anywhere,” said Bardella. “I think he just gave up, which, frankly, I think anyone in that position would do.” (Only two other entities seemed to be able overrule Bannon at any given time: __Rebekah Mercer,__long under the sway of her political guru, and <strong>Susie Breitbart,</strong> Andrew’s widow, widely considered an enigma in the company.)</p>\n<div class=\"embed cneembed\"><div class=\"embed block cneembed\" data-url=\"//player.cnevids.com/script/video/5a3298792d1ca07002000005.js?muted=1\"></div></div><p>Marlow won’t take over Bannon’s title as executive chairman, and it’s unclear if there will ever <em>be</em> another executive chairman. As fundamentally decent as Marlow may be, he lacks the magnetic, charismatic personality that defined both Bannon and Andrew and essentially ensured that their employees&#8212;mostly hired fresh out of college and now in their late 20s and early 30s&#8212;could hardly step up. Unlike the media outlets it hoped to compete against, which tend to promote individual writers and personalities, it’s hard for anyone outside Breitbart’s core audience to name a single reporter for the site. ”As much as [Bannon critic] <strong>Ben Shapiro</strong> can complain about this and that and Steve mucking up Andrew’s legacy&#8212;which he totally did&#8212;he did it with Susie’s permission and with Larry’s permission, so there’s something to be said about that,” the source continued. “No one stood up. It’s like a trickle: if everyone would have rushed the gate, Steve would have backed down . . . Instead, one person at a time took on Steve, and they lost.”</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>The last time Marlow had full control of the site, after Bannon left for the White House, Breitbart began moving in a confused new direction: it would be a journalistic outlet, staffed with real journalists from mainstream publications, which would do real investigative reporting. <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/05/breitbart-traffic-numbers-are-cratering\">Traffic slipped over a period of months</a>. At the time, former Breitbart employees with an ax to grind complained that Marlow lacked Bannon and Breitbart’s magic touch. But a source within the company disputed that it was Marlow’s fault. “When Steve was in the White House, at any point in time, on any day of the week, he could have quit and said, ‘I’m back, let’s get back to my vision.’ Now there’s no chance of that, and that gives Alex a bit more freedom.” Without the specter of Bannon lurking over Marlow’s shoulder, the source continued, “I think that’ll make us a lot more comfortable with that [freedom], and in him.”</p>\n<p>Several issues will likely determine the site’s longterm survival, according to people familiar with the inner workings of the company, starting with its SiriusXM radio show, a key tool for reaching beyond its online fan base. Bannon had initially hosted the show, but now the duties may fall to a less recognizable talent, like Breitbart London editor <strong>Raheem Kassam,</strong> a frequent host himself with a strong fan base, who nevertheless lacks the name-brand popularity of his former boss. (Several people indicated that Kassam’s British accent may also be an impediment in hosting a red-meat, pro-Trump show.) Breitbart’s future also depends on whether the site can move beyond its roots as the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/04/the-battle-for-breitbart-after-bannon\">right-wing’s greatest aggregation machine</a>, packaged with Marlow’s inspired and incendiary and Drudge-ready headlines, and actually begin to do serious journalism. Or maybe serious journalism isn’t what Breitbart readers want, and the site will merely chug along on the traffic bestowed by those Drudge Report links. The Mercer money may be secure, given that Rebekah went out of her way to oust Bannon and protect the company. But the revenue stream, dented by an <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2017/06/08/breitbart-lost-90-percent-of-its-advertisers-in-two-months-whos-still-there/?utm_term=.447ebae6d447\">advertising exodus</a>, will keep the future in doubt.</p>\n<p>And then there is the challenge of meeting the expectations of the Cult of Andrew, which is especially severe since it’s unclear what the charismatic founder’s vision would have looked like in a more cynical, jaded 2018, with conservatives in power but failing miserably. Meanwhile, the Cult of Bannon within the company, a much smaller crew, has remained largely silent, with the hope that one day Bannon will be vindicated. The biggest challenge, of course, is that the guard has changed, passing from two dramatically aggrieved baby boomers more in touch with the Trump base to a group of twentysomethings and thirtysomethings hoping to find their way, never having been led without a monster at the helm. They may hit hard above their weight, and they may eventually have a confident leader in charge. But it may not matter whether Marlow takes the site in a more earnest direction, or whether it defaults to aping Steve or Andrew: Breitbart will probably not be fully re-energized until there’s a Democrat in the Oval Office.</p>\n</section>","channel":"News","subChannel":"Politics","tags":["breitbart","steve bannon","marlow","larry solov","right-wing site"],"ledeCaption":"Steve Bannon addresses a crowd of Roy Moore supporters at a rally in Midland City, December 11, 2017.","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"dek":"As Breitbart comes to terms with Bannon’s ouster, some hope to return the site to an entity its namesake founder would have appreciated.

Talk Himself Out of His Own Movement?","body":"<p><strong>Steve Bannon</strong> had just finished hosting his daily Breitbart radio show on Wednesday morning when he received an urgent e-mail from an adviser. <strong>Donald Trump Jr.</strong> had just called; he was <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/01/papadopoulos-trump-campaigns-clinton-dirt-diggers-collaborate\">furious over quotes</a> attributed to Bannon that appear in <strong>Michael Wolff’s</strong> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/01/the-7-most-shocking-details-from-michael-wolffs-bombshell-trump-book\">bombshell new book</a> about the Trump White House. The Guardian had obtained a copy and was reporting that Bannon called Trump Jr.’s June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Russians “treasonous” and “unpatriotic.” Bannon’s shocking comments seemed to suggest the Trump campaign colluded with Russia&#8212;or at least tried to. The adviser warned that Bannon risked his political future if he didn’t issue a statement walking them back. “This is the president’s <em>family</em>,” one Bannon ally told me.</p>\n<p>While Bannon had granted Wolff extensive access, he was caught off guard by the book’s rollout and hadn’t read <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/03/donald-trump-russia-steve-bannon-michael-wolff\">the Guardian piece</a>. Working from the Breitbart Embassy, steps from Capitol Hill, Bannon quickly organized a series of conference calls with his kitchen Cabinet that included, among others, political adviser <strong>Andy Surabian;</strong> Breitbart Washington editor <strong>Matt Boyle;</strong> communications strategist <strong>Arthur Schwartz;</strong> and Breitbart London editor <strong>Raheem Kassam.</strong> According to sources briefed on the conversations, Bannon denied making the comments about Trump Jr. to Wolff, but was resistant to the idea of issuing a statement disputing them. He explained to his advisers that Trump Jr. “surely knew” he would never say those things to a journalist. “Steve was like, ‘I don’t respond to bullshit attacks,’” a source briefed on the conversation said. (Bannon declined to comment).</p>\n<p>The other people on the line told Bannon he was badly misjudging the situation. “Steve can be kind of delusional,” a Bannon ally told me. Bannon’s camp had been in touch with Trump Jr. and White House official <strong>Ira Greenstein</strong> throughout the morning, and they were told the president was preparing for war if Bannon didn’t recant. Another concern: Bannonworld worried that while Trump Jr. was a media punch line, he remained highly popular with the deplorables from his many appearances on the campaign trail. In a blood feud with Trump’s son, Bannon might actually lose. “The base loves Don Jr.,” an adviser said. And, in the early stages of the crisis, the Breitbart audience, Bannon’s own constituency since before the president began his campaign, appeared to be siding with Trump.</p>\n<p>Reluctantly, after much lobbying, Bannon agreed to draft a statement. According to a person who viewed the draft, it read Trump Jr. was a “patriot” who “loves his country,” and went on to trash Wolff. A copy was sent to both the White House and Don Jr., and was approved. The plan was to release it to Axios’s Jonathan Swan.</p>\n<p>But Bannon had waited too long. Around 2 P.M., Trump released a blistering four-paragraph statement ripping Bannon and questioning his mental health. “Steve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my Presidency. When he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind,” Trump said. “Now that he is on his own, Steve is learning that winning isn’t as easy as I make it look.” The level of vitriol in the press release reflected the contempt Trump had built up for Bannon. On his way to Mar-a-Lago for Christmas, Trump had reportedly wanted to flame Bannon for comments Bannon <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/12/bannon-for-president-trump-kushner-ivanka\">had made to me</a> about his disdain for <strong>Ivanka</strong> and <strong>Jared Kushner,</strong> not to mention his frustration with Trump; but at the time, White House aides successfully persuaded Trump not to speak out.</p>\n<div class=\"embed cneembed\"><div class=\"embed block cneembed\" data-url=\"//player.cnevids.com/script/video/5a3298792d1ca07002000005.js?muted=1\"></div></div><p>Bannon, predictably, reacted to Trump’s statement by digging in. He refused to issue his own statement and told advisers the controversy would blow over. But as some advisers had warned, Bannon’s situation deteriorated rapidly over the next 24 hours. On Thursday, at the urging of White House Communications Director <strong>Hope Hicks,</strong> said a source, Trump advisers fanned out in the media to attack Bannon. Some of the candidates Bannon has pledged to support in 2018 distanced from him. The campaign of Arizona Senate candidate <strong>Kelli Ward,</strong> a charter member of Bannon’s insurgent slate, quickly issued a statement: “Steve Bannon is only one of many high-profile endorsements Dr. Ward has received.”</p>\n<p>Worse, Bannon’s billionaire benefactor, <strong>Rebekah Mercer,</strong> released a statement saying her family hadn’t spoken to Bannon in “months,” won’t support Bannon’s political agenda, and remains committed to Trump. The Mercers are major investors in Breitbart. Mercer, who almost never speaks to the media, released the statement after being lobbied by Trump, the Daily Beast reported. Bannon allies believe that <strong>Kellyanne Conway,</strong> who in the past did polling for Mercer, was also enlisted to lobby her. (A White House official said Conway did not lobby Mercer.) <em>The New York Times</em> reported that the Mercers cut off funding for Bannon’s security detail.</p>\n<p>Bannon’s position at Breitbart has since become precarious. Mercer, C.E.O. <strong>Larry Solov,</strong> and Andrew Breitbart’s widow reportedly have held conversations about whether Bannon should be removed as executive chairman of the company. One concern, according to sources, is what firing Bannon would mean for the Web site’s lucrative contract with Sirius XM Satellite Radio. “Rebekah is very deliberate. She wants to see how this plays out,” a Breitbart source told me.</p>\n<p>Yet even before Bannon escalated his war against Trump, some at Breitbart wanted Bannon out. According to sources, Solov and Breitbart editor-in-chief <strong>Alex Marlow</strong> did not want Bannon back when he was forced out of the White House in August. (Marlow disputes this characterization: “I was excited when Steve came back,” he said when reached for comment. “His return provided incredible opportunity for the company.”) Mercer, too, was concerned that Bannon’s political crusade to defenestrate Senate Majority Leader <strong>Mitch McConnell</strong> was fundamentally at odds with his role as a news executive, a Bannon ally told me. “Steve thinks he can do everything on the planet all at the same time,” the ally said.</p>\n<p>Now, as Bannon awaits his fate, he’s doubling down on what he does best: talk. He’s been continuing to host his daily radio show. “The president of the United States is a great man,” he said on <em>Breitbart News Tonight.</em> “You know I support him day in and day out.”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, he’s telling advisers and journalists he’s not being removed from Breitbart. On the Thursday-evening editorial call, he batted away questions about his future. “He was like, ‘This is all nonsense,’” one person on the call said.</p>\n<p><em>This article has been updated.</em></p>","channel":"News","subChannel":"Politics","tags":["steve bannon","michael wolff","donald trump","breibart"],"ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"dek":"After his comments about Don Jr. in Michael Wolff’s book were leaked, Bannon was ready to defend the president’s son and attack his new journalistic adversary&#8212;until Trump struck first.

In <em>Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,</em> an early copy of which was obtained by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/03/donald-trump-russia-steve-bannon-michael-wolff?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\"><em>The Guardian</em></a>, Wolff reported that <strong>Steve Bannon,</strong> the brazen chairman of Breitbart News and former Trump campaign C.E.O., had bashed Trump’s son, <strong>Don Jr.,</strong> saying that he was “treasonous” and “unpatriotic” for taking a meeting with a Russian lawyer, and&#8212;horror of horrors&#8212;speculating that Trump himself knew of the collusion.</p>\n<p>This, of course, <em>had</em> to be fake news coming from left-wing M.S.M. “shills,” wrote Shadowman3001, the moderator of the pro-Trump reddit r/The_Donald. “[Bannon] helped Trump get elected possibly more than anyone. Have some faith,” he initially posted. When journalists began circulating a nuclear press release from Trump himself, which declared that Bannon had “lost his mind” and was “in it for himself,” Shadowman3001 remained skeptical. “It hasn’t been posted to the official [White House] page,” he protested. But as soon as <strong>Sarah Huckabee Sanders</strong> appeared at the podium to confirm the statement, erasing all doubt as to Trump’s sentiments, Shadowman3001 immediately crossed out all his previous statements and declared: “Looks like we have a new enemy.” (He later <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/7nvom3/i_trust_the_media_now_regarding_bannon/\">deleted his comments altogether</a>.)</p>\n<p>Trump, it seemed, had given his marching orders, and his base followed. Subsequent anti-Bannon sentiment began bubbling in the Internet cesspools where Trumpism began, like the comments section of right-wing sites such r/The_Donald and Breitbart.com itself, to the glee of the Internet. “I voted for Trump[,] I didn’t vote for Bannon,” said the highest-rated comment on the site, pegged to a straightforward news article writing up Trump’s statement. “I’ll stick with Trump, thanks.” Others vented that Bannon had been responsible for pushing <strong>Roy Moore,</strong> an anti-gay candidate and therefore the least Breitbartian candidate possible. (“That right there should show you how big a fool Bannon turned out to be.”) Even their Twitter account’s attempt at meta-humor&#8212;retweeting a <em>Mother Jones</em> reporter covering the backlash&#8212;resulted in readers calling Bannon a “traitor” and promising a boycott.</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/BarbAnn_PA/status/948674645892444161\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BarbAnn_PA/status/948674645892444161\">https://twitter.com/BarbAnn_PA/status/948674645892444161</a></p></blockquote></div><p></p>\n<p>The response to the Wolff book in the provinces of the right amounted to a referendum on Bannon’s hubristic campaign for domination. In the squabbling world of the populist-nationalist movement&#8212;Bannon’s associates (many of whom hate him), Bannon’s industry peers (who <em>loathe</em> him), and even those who were merely Trump supporters and watched Bannon from afar&#8212;there was a surprising sense of unity. “The idea that Steve Bannon is the great manipulator behind the scenes who really has the plan and the worldview is completely bullshit. Trump said exactly what I’ve been saying for months,” <strong>Ben Shapiro,</strong> Breitbart’s former editor-at-large and harsh Trump critic, vented to me. “It’ll change people’s views because Trump said it. It’s equally right when anyone says it, but Trump saying it just makes it more powerful and more clear to any of his supporters.”</p>\n<p>As for whether the base would stand by Bannon, who had appointed himself Trump’s “wingman” outside the White House and vowed to keep him informed about the populist mood, an editor at a competing conservative news site predicted otherwise. “Bannon was just hit by a MOAB,” said the editor. “The base will stick with the guy who gave the order.” (Bannon’s representative did not return repeated requests for comment.)</p>\n<p>Some saw something almost biblical in Bannon’s perfidy. “This is a movement that’s very sensitive to the idea of betrayal,” said former Breitbart writer and pro-Trump commentator <strong>Kurt Schlichter.</strong> “He looked like he went to the media and betrayed us.”</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>No one I spoke to expected that Bannon would get even the smallest bit of help from his fellow right-wing media colleagues. “Who likes Steve Bannon?!” laughed Schlichter, who has a long-running feud with the man and, during our conversation, called Bannon a “jerk,” an “egomaniac,” “expendable,” and a “wart” on the populist-nationalist movement. Indeed, many of his right-wing enemies celebrated his excommunication, from his Internet media-mogul foe <strong>Matt Drudge</strong> (who dedicated the top half of the Drudge Report to stories bashing Bannon for nearly half a day), to a slew of writers he’d been in conflict with over the years. “I told you all years ago,” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DLoesch/status/948651543166902278\">tweeted <strong>Dana Loesch</strong></a>, a former Breitbart contributor, who&#39;d once sued Breitbart (since settled), with Bannon at its head, after a business relationship soured. Even people tangentially related to the world of Breitbart, like <strong>Newt Gingrich,</strong> <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2018/01/03/gingrich-bannon-has-exaggerated-sense-self-importance.html\">dismissed Bannon</a> as having an “exaggerated sense of self-importance”&#8212;and Fox News, the media outlet most symbiotic with the Trump administration, eagerly piled on. “That is a two-by-four to the head of Steve Bannon,” a flabbergasted <strong>Ari Fleischer</strong> <a href=\"http://insider.foxnews.com/2018/01/03/ari-fleischer-president-trump-took-2x4-head-steve-bannon\">told Fox News host <strong>Dana Perino</strong></a>, agreeing with her suggestion that Bannon was done for. (Only two notable right-wing figures publicly supported Bannon: <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/london/2018/01/04/kassam-deplorables-dont-choose-between-trump-bannon/\"><strong>Raheem Kassam</strong></a>, the site’s London editor, and Breitbart’s disgraced and <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/11/bob-mercer-defunds-milo-yiannopoulos-sells-stake-in-breitbart\">de-funded</a> ex-superstar, <strong>Milo Yiannopoulos,</strong> who <a href=\"https://twitter.com/willsommer/status/948649876648284167\">issued a statement</a> praising his former boss.)</p>\n<p>With any other politician who attacked him, Bannon would have likely revved up the #WAR machine and directed his army of angry Internet honey-badger trolls against his enemies. But he had been losing allies for weeks already: <em>The Washington Post</em> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-slams-bannon-when-he-was-fired-he-not-only-lost-his-job-he-lost-his-mind/2018/01/03/21fb158a-f0aa-11e7-b3bf-ab90a706e175_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_bannon-150pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&amp;utm_term=.cc58b52a378b\">reported the next day</a> that his longtime patron, <strong>Rebekah Mercer,</strong> had withdrawn all her funding from his personal projects, angry at his claims that she would back his possible 2020 run for president, while another source close to both Bannon and the Mercers suggested that there had also been talk of shutting down Bannon’s film production company, Glittering Steel. By Thursday morning, there was a full-blown campaign to get <strong>Larry Solov</strong> and <strong>Susie Breitbart,</strong> who both <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2017/02/breitbart-reveals-owners-ceo-larry-solov-mercer-family-and-susie-breitrbart-235358\">own majority stakes</a> in Breitbart News along with Mercer, to fire Bannon, who serves as executive chairman at their discretion. Drudge had <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DRUDGE/status/948939676718530560\">tweeted his support</a> for the pair, calling them the team that would “take Breitbart into the fresh future”&#8212;presumably one where Bannon did not repel their readership of deplorables.</p>\n<div class=\"embed cneembed\"><div class=\"embed block cneembed\" data-url=\"//player.cnevids.com/script/video/5a3298792d1ca07002000005.js?muted=1\"></div></div><p>Whether that would happen, the source said, remained in the hands of Solov, who co-founded the site with Andrew Breitbart 10 years ago. He speculated that the site’s profitability could be a major issue factored into Bannon’s survival. “Solov would only alpha up if there was a money issue,” he said. “Susie would only step up if it was destroy[ing] Andrew. I think both happened.”  Mercer, meanwhile, made her thoughts clear in an <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2018/01/04/mercer-issues-rare-public-rebuke-of-former-ally-bannon/?utm_term=.4eb1976bedcf\">extremely rare statement to the <em>Washington Post</em></a>.  “My family and I have not communicated with Steve Bannon in many months and have provided no financial support to his political agenda, nor do we support his recent actions and statements,” she said. (A representative for Breitbart did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)</p>\n<p>The Bannon saga did not unfold without mainstream media bashing, of course; several Trump supporters went after Wolff himself and accused him of making up the story altogether, and MAGA Twitter personality <strong>Jack Posobiec</strong> insisted to me that Wolff was a chronic “exaggerator,” citing an article from <em>The New Republic.</em> That said, Posobiec, who does not often intersect with the Bannon-Breitbart orbit professionally, saw Trump’s statement as a “loyalty test” of whether his supporters would stand with him against Bannon. “The base <em>will</em> side with Trump,” he predicted, Wolff’s M.S.M. ties be damned. “We’ve been with him since 2015.”</p>\n<p>For former Breitbart correspondent <strong>Lee Stranahan,</strong> however, Trump excommunicating Bannon wasn’t even a test. “This helps his standing with the base <em>massively,</em>” he told me, saying that his own Twitter timeline was exploding with anti-Bannon sentiment. He added that he was ecstatic when Don Jr. weighed in with a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/948638652850061312\">highly specific attack against Bannon</a>, one that had only circulated among the right-wing populist crowd for years: that Bannon’s hubris betrayed the mission of the deceased Breitbart himself. “That tweet was music to my ears,” he said.</p>\n<p>“What people don’t understand about this movement [is that] it is not individuals. It’s not even Donald Trump, and I think Donald Trump is smart enough to understand that,” Schlichter suggested. “Bannon never did. Bannon thought the movement was him personally. No. If he’s useful, he can be part of the movement. If not, if he’s causing problems, he’s going to get abandoned.”</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>As the Internet and Fox News turned against Bannon, he secluded himself in the self-contained world of talk radio. Later that night, Bannon entered the alternate world of his Sirius XM show, and proceeded to act as if everything was normal, mentioning absolutely nothing about Trump’s attacks and focusing solely on immigration, the red meatiest of Breitbart issues. When a caller finally asked Bannon about the comments, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/oliverdarcy/status/948764898028412929\">two hours into the show</a>, Bannon demurred: “The president of the United States is a great man. You know I support him day in and day out.” The front page of Breitbart, too, had quietly been scrubbed of the Bannon story, reverting to their regular content diet of voter fraud and immigration posts. On Twitter, Breitbart writers and editors gamely <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brandondarby/status/948596576703995904\">batted away suggestions</a> that Trump’s attacks had fazed them, or that they would <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RaheemKassam/status/948699013892669441\">turn against Trump</a>.</p>\n<p>Trump, however, had decisively turned against them. As Bannon pontificated on the radio, Trump’s lawyers sent him a cease-and-desist letter demanding that he stop making defamatory comments about Trump and his family, and accusing him of breaking a non-disclosure agreement he signed when he joined the campaign. “Legal action is imminent,” Trump’s personal attorney, <strong>Charles Harder,</strong> <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-attorney-sends-bannon-cease-desist-letter-disparaging/story?id=52128555\">told ABC News</a>. Harder, it must be pointed out, was the lawyer who represented Hulk Hogan in the lawsuit that effectively destroyed Gawker Media, suddenly adding an ominous pall to an <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/948632834000019457\">earlier tweet Don Jr.</a> had sent: “When Bannon has lost Breitbart, he’s left with . . . um, nothing.”</p>\n<p>“He reaped what he sowed,” the conservative media editor added. “If Bannon hadn&#39;t used so many people on his climb to the top, he might have had a few hands to catch him during his fall to the bottom.”</p>\n</section>","channel":"News","subChannel":"Politics","tags":["right wing media","alt right","steve bannon","breibart news","donald trump"],"ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"dek":"The angry tide against the Breitbart chairman reached a fever pitch in the midst of Michael Wolff-gate.

And then there are people like casino mogul <strong>Steve Wynn</strong>, who responded to his own disturbing accusations by gathering his employees and reminding them that he could very easily have fired them in the past, but he didn’t&#8212;because he thinks of them as a <em>family.</em></p>\n<p>In the wake of reports that Wynn allegedly forced employees to have sex with him and <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/dozens-of-people-recount-pattern-of-sexual-misconduct-by-las-vegas-mogul-steve-wynn-1516985953\">“often walked around some areas of the [Wynn Resorts] complex in extremely short shorts without underwear, and . . . would sit in the salon to get pedicures in such a way that his genitals were exposed</a>,” the C.E.O., who has categorically denied all such allegations, has held a series of meetings with staff urging them to “rally to his side,” according to <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/steve-wynn-calls-on-employees-to-rally-behind-him-during-company-meetings-1517567401\"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>. Over the course of these meetings, Wynn has reportedly:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Reminded everyone that during the last recession “his company didn’t lay off employees as other Las Vegas strip operators did”;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Told employees that he thinks of them as “family”;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Insisted that Wynn Resorts has always been a huge fan of women, saying that the company has “always trusted, respected, and honored women,” and not because it’s “fashionable or that’s the topic of the season”;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Posited that the company wouldn’t have its glowing reputation if “we had predators running around”;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Chosen to recount a dinner he had with <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/women-accused-trump-sexual-misconduct-list-2017-12\">accused serial abuser <strong>Donald Trump</strong></a> shortly after the emergence of the infamous <em>Access Hollywood</em> tape, saying that Trump had told him “It was so scary. When those tapes came out, I almost died.” Wynn told the employees, “I know the feeling”; and</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Thought, hey, while I have everyone’s attention, why not praise the new tax law? (“You guys are going to love it,” he reportedly told the group assembled).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Wynn, who has seen his company’s stock <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/01/steve-wynn-sexual-misconduct-allegations-reported-in-wall-street-journal\">plummet</a> in the wake of the allegations, is facing investigations by regulators in Massachusetts, Nevada, and Macau, and has put his board in the uncomfortable position of having to explain why it <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/wynn-resorts-board-faces-scrutiny-following-allegations-against-steve-wynn-1517338504\">didn’t previously disclose a $7.5 million settlement with a former resort manicurist who says he forced her to have sex with him</a>. To top it off, the mogul apparently wrapped up one meeting by promising those who believed in him a little something extra in their paychecks: “Just so long as that doesn’t bug any of you I’m happy, and I’m happy if you’re happy,” he said. “Your jobs will be secure, and your incomes will increase, and you’ll have a chance for a better future as this company grows and moves ahead.” (A Wynn Resorts spokesman <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/steve-wynn-calls-on-employees-to-rally-behind-him-during-company-meetings-1517567401\">said</a> that the <em>Journal</em>’s account “[did not] reflect the [meeting’s] general tenor,” and explained that Wynn declined to address the allegations because that was “not the purpose of the meeting.”)</p>\n<p><em><strong>If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, <a href=\"http://tinyletter.com/besslevin\">click here</a> to subscribe.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Calling all exorcists</strong></p>\n<p>The Dow dropped 666 points on Friday, the biggest plunge <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-01/asia-stocks-to-slide-as-tech-stumbles-bonds-drop-markets-wrap\">since June 2016</a>, setting the president up for a tweet about how even when <em>his</em> market falls off a cliff, they do so in a <em>yuge,</em> record-setting fashion. <a href=\"http://markets.wsj.com/?mod=Home_MDW_MDC\">Elsewhere</a>, the S&amp;P dropped 59.85 points, the NASDAQ fell by 144.92, and Apple hit its lowest point since October.

We were celebrating, congratulating him on his victory. He says, ‘You’ve got to come help me. You’ve got to drop that stupid business of yours. I can give you a’&#8212;you know how he talks&#8212;‘I can give you an agency that’s 40 times the size of your business. Drop that stupid business of yours and come work for me.’ I said, ‘O.K. I’m happy to help.’”</p>\n<p>Scaramucci, the Wall Street hedge-fund impresario and <strong>Donald Trump’s</strong> perfect foil, is irrepressible. Some six months after his historically short-lived tenure as the White House communications director, he has embarked on something of a rehabilitation tour. He has been defending Trump in Davos, on CNN, and in <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> when few others have, or would. The obvious subtext is that, in these difficult days, the president needs a friend&#8212;and the Mooch, as he is known, is the most loyal friend there is. Could Anthony Scaramucci actually talk his way back into the West Wing? In Trumpworld, stranger things have happened.</p>\n<p>In a series of three epic interviews, Scaramucci, whom I’ve known for nearly a decade, told me his origin story, beginning as an Italian kid in Port Washington, on Long Island&#8212;his father spent 42 years digging up the sand that was used to build Manhattan skyscrapers. It was when his father cashed a $10,000 insurance policy to help put him through Tufts, where he played football, that Scaramucci had “my epiphany,” he told me. “I’m not gonna be this gold-chain-adorned guy driving around as a Long Island guido.”</p>\n<p>Then, when he went to Harvard Law, his mother thought he was going to Hartford, Connecticut. “She’s got the map out,” he said. “I said, ‘No, ma, we’re going to Harvard.’” Then it was on to Goldman Sachs and, from there, the cutthroat world of hedge funds. That’s when his real education began, but it still didn‘t prepare him for what was to come. “I want you to imagine the worst person that you’ve met on Wall Street, the most ruthless and the most diabolical,” he told me. “That’s the best person in Washington. That’s the Eagle Scout of Washington.”</p>\n<p>The West Wing was supposed to be the capstone to the Mooch’s unlikely rise. On January 12, 2017, <strong>Rick Dearborn,</strong> the executive director of the transition team, wrote that the Office of the President-Elect had offered him the job of assistant to the president and director of the Office of Public Liaison in the White House. It was pretty much the same job that <strong>Valerie Jarrett</strong> had in the Obama White House. It was a big deal, and he accepted the offer quickly. “I’m given the job of O.P.L. director, which is actually a perfect job for me,” he said. “I’m gonna be his public liaison of the corporations.”</p>\n<p>To go into the White House, and in order to be free of any potential conflicts, he had to agree to sell his majority stake in SkyBridge Capital, his New York City-based hedge fund-of-funds. He hired <strong>Greg Fleming,</strong> a longtime financial institutions banker at Merrill Lynch and then a senior executive at both Merrill and Morgan Stanley, to run the auction process. Scaramucci eventually selected a consortium led by HNA Group Co. Ltd., a big Chinese conglomerate, and RON Transatlantic, as the buyers. There was another potential buyer that was offering a higher price, but that buyer also said it needed financing and intended to fire more than half of the SkyBridge employees. “I have 70 people on staff,” he said. “They were gonna let go 45 of them. So I’m like, ‘O.K. I’m not doing that to these people. I built this company with these people. I’m not blowing out 45.’</p>\n<p>“So I said, ‘O.K., I’ll take the second-highest bid. This looks like they’re an unbelievable company.’ I meet all the people. I like them. They’re a global Fortune 500 company. Then we make the announcement on the deal, and then the hits start.</p>\n<p>“Rancid Penis”&#8212;the Mooch’s name for <strong>Reince Priebus,</strong> then Trump’s chief of staff&#8212;“you know, he just cannot believe this. He’s just very jealous, can’t believe I’m this close to Trump. Priebus had the society broken up into ‘Always Trumpers’ and ‘Never Trumpers,’ and he was trying to flood the White House staff, as the chief of staff, with ‘Never Trumpers,’ and trying to figure out ways to blockade, slow down, and keep out, particularly of the White House, the ‘Trumper-Trumpers.’</p>\n<p>“So, when the president turned to me and said he wanted to give me the O.P.L. job, I got a call from Reince: ‘Don’t take the O.P.L. job. You can be the finance director for the R.N.C. Stay at your company.’ Blah, blah, blah. I said, ‘No, no, no. I’m gonna take the O.P.L. job. I want to work with the president.’ How many times in my life am I gonna be able to work in the White House and work for the president of the United States? And Reince’s answer was, ‘Actually, I’m gonna do everything I can [to help you].’ He did say this because he’s a Washingtonian. That’s what they do to you, they say, ‘golly gee’ to your face and they act like Richie Cunningham to your face. They’re Richie Cunningham and they’re Opie from <em>The Andy Griffith Show,</em> but they’re the fucking Sith Lord behind your back. They’re hitting you with a lightsaber behind your back.” In fact, according to Scaramucci, Priebus disinvited Scaramucci’s parents from the January 22 swearing-in ceremony for the new White House staff.</p>\n<p>Scaramucci believes that his decision to sell his stake in SkyBridge to HNA and RON gave Priebus an opening to try to get rid of him, or at least keep him from getting a job so close to Trump. “If I had sold to Blackstone, there would have been no opening there,” he continued. “Now he’s got his opening: ‘China, China, China.’ He goes to Trump. He says, ‘Oh my God. They’re selling to China. He probably got a high price from them. They think they’re gonna curry favor with you.’ He convinces Trump that I have a legal problem. I don’t.”</p>\n<p>The Mooch continued: “He gets this whole nefarious research packet over to <em>The New York Times.</em> They love this stuff. Boom: HNA is this mysterious, nefarious company. Then he goes to <strong>[Steve] Bannon</strong> [then Trump’s chief strategist] and he says, ‘I’m gonna get you on the National Security Council if that’s where you want to go, but you’ve got to join forces with me and take out Scaramucci.’” (A source close to Bannon said it was “laughable” to think that he agreed to join forces with Priebus against Scaramucci to get on the N.S.C.) Scaramucci continued, “I helped Bannon through the three months that he was on the campaign, and we had a good relationship. But Bannon turns on me, because Bannon is ultimately railing against the swamp, but he’s actually a cock of the swamp. He’s the creature from the Black Lagoon, Bannon. He acts more swamp-like than any person that’s ever become a Washingtonian. So for all of his railing on the swamp, he is literally the pig in George Orwell’s <em>Animal Farm</em> that stands on his two legs the minute he gets power. He is the creature from the Black Lagoon.</p>\n<p>“Now I realize that he’s turned on me and I go to see him,” he continued. “I said, ‘You’re out of your mind. Why have you turned on me?’ The O.P.L. [job] got put on ice because of ‘China, China, China and Reince, Reince, Reince.’ I pushed Priebus. I say, ‘Hey, we’re gonna be in trouble here now because you’re lying to the president about me.’ He says, ‘O.K. Don’t go to the press on that. I’m gonna give you one of these ambassadorships. You’ll be the ambassador to the O.E.C.D.’”</p>\n<p>According to Scaramucci, Priebus kept that promise; he and Bannon recommended Scaramucci to be the United States ambassador to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, in Paris. The position came with a 17-room apartment in Paris. He was going to move there with his family. But the position, like any ambassadorship, required Senate approval, which would take a few months. In the meantime, according to Scaramucci, Priebus found the Mooch a desk job at the Export-Import Bank, in Washington. (The source close to Bannon said, “Bannon was the leading advocate for Anthony’s appointment to O.E.C.D. to get Senate confirmation, and later the possible opportunity to become a deputy Cabinet secretary or Cabinet secretary.”)</p>\n<p>Trump, meanwhile, had been thinking seriously about pulling the plug on the Export-Import Bank, and one day summoned the Mooch to the Oval Office to talk about it. “He says, ‘O.K., you’re a smart guy. You were there for three weeks. Do I kill the bank or keep the bank?’” Scaramucci said. “I said, ‘You keep the bank.’ I gave him a one-page memo, explained to him why he should keep the bank. So Trump agreed with me, yeah. <strong>Jared [Kushner]</strong> said that Trump likes me because he realizes [that], like his father, I came from nowhere and had nothing. I was able to build myself up and hold my own in any situation. So he likes asking me my opinion because I usually have pretty good common-sense advice.”</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>By mid-July, the script changed again. And Mooch, who had originally <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/05/how-donald-trump-made-wall-street-kiss-his-ring\">supported</a> <strong>Scott Walker,</strong> and then <strong>Jeb Bush,</strong> and suffered the resulting vicissitudes, seemed poised for a White House post. “Now, all of a sudden, I’m making a detour into the West Wing, because the president realizes that he’s got a huge problem on his hands,” Scaramucci said. “Go back [to July] and look at the news cycles. What was going on was absolute berserkazoid craziness: internecine warfare, leaks every 13 seconds, Bannon leaking on everybody, Priebus leaking on everybody, total chaos in the White House, total disorganization.”</p>\n<p>Scaramucci’s cell phone rang. It was the White House. He was invited to come to the Oval Office to meet with Trump, with a stop first to see <strong>Ivanka.</strong> Scaramucci was not sure what this was all about. “And I don’t care,” he said. “Remember, I’m not intimidated by Trump. I have a relationship with him. I said that to him once in the Oval: ‘By the way, how do you want me to talk to you? Do you want me to talk to you like you’re the president of the United States, the way these other people talk to you, or do you want me to talk to you the way I was talking to you on the campaign, or when we were friends? Tell me which way you want to go here. Obviously, when they’re around I’ll say ‘Mr. President’ and all the sycophantic stuff, but when we’re alone, how do you want me to talk to you?’ [Replied Trump:] ‘You’ve got to talk to me like we’re friends.’”</p>\n<p>The Mooch went to see Ivanka Trump in the White House, as requested. “So I go over that day,” he said. “I go see Ivanka. They clearly don’t want Priebus to know that I’m coming. I go through the door. There’s a study off the Oval Office. I’m sitting there with the president. Ivanka’s open with me. She says, ‘We have to re-structure.’”</p>\n<p>There was a discussion of the president’s approval rating. “The president said, ‘What do you think is going on?’ I said, ‘Well, you’ve got to fix this situation with the media. Here are five or six things you can do immediately that would correct the situation, but the first thing you have to do is you’ve got a rocky situation here because you’ve got ‘Always Trumpers’ and R.N.C. people. Someone has to come in here and meld this culture together. And you got to stop the leaking. So you’ve got to get rid of these leakers.’</p>\n<p>“So he says to me, ‘Well, will you come in and help me do that?’ I said, ‘Yeah. When? When do you want me to come in?’ He goes, ‘How about tomorrow? How about at 10 A.M. we’ll make you the comms director? You come in and help me fix this.’”</p>\n<p>Scaramucci accepted Trump’s offer. “‘I’m gonna go out there and turn the lights back on and all the cameras and everything, and we’re gonna try to open it up a little bit,’” he told Trump. “I brought <em>The New York Times</em> in for an interview that week . . . The president knows that Bannon and Priebus are horrific leakers. He’s not a stupid guy.” He headed back to New York City for the night.</p>\n<div class=\"callout large has-pullquote\" data-type=\"callout\"><div class=\"embed pullquote\" data-type=\"pullquote\"><span><blockquote>\n<p>“He’s the creature from the Black Lagoon, Bannon.

They’re hiring oppo people: have I sexually harassed any women in my office? Please, dear God, hopefully he has. Did he do anything nefarious on Wall Street?”</p>\n<p>The Mooch made it through the night. He took a six A.M. flight from New York City to Washington, thinking he would be sworn in as the new White House director of communications four hours later. “I’m sitting at the Trump Hotel, where I am staying when I’m in Washington, I’ve got myself a cup of coffee, and my phone is ringing,” he said. “By the way, Reince Priebus had been calling me throughout the previous evening and texting me. I did not respond to him. He said, ‘Please call me. We’ve got to get on the same page on this. I’m the chief of staff, you’ve got to call me. I’m hearing things and I want to confirm whether or not they’re true.’ Blah, blah, blah. At the same time that he was doing that, he was also texting reporters that this is a publicity stunt by Anthony, that there’s no truth to this, there’s no veracity to this.” (Priebus did not respond to specific questions regarding this article.)</p>\n<p>“I think he wasn’t sure,” Scaramucci continued. “I think he was trying to get to the bottom of it, and to persuade Trump not to do this, that this was a mistake. And so he figured that by the morning he would have Trump talked out of it, and he and Bannon were obviously working overtime to try and convince Trump not to do it.”</p>\n<p>At the Trump Hotel, it was Stephen Bannon on the line. “Oh, it’s Steve Bannon! This is a guy I thought was a friend. This is a guy who I wrote a 10-point memo for when he joined the campaign. And I was working alongside of him throughout the time during the campaign, right? O.K., so now I’m in the Trump Hotel. The phone is ringing and Steve says, ‘How are you?’ ‘How am I? What do you mean how am I?’ He says, ‘Hey, you want to know something? You want to know what your chances are to become the comms director this morning here at the White House? You want to know what your chances are?’ I said, ‘What are my chances, Stephen?’ [Replied Bannon]: ‘Zero! You got that, man? Zero. You got it? Zero.’ I said, ‘Zero, O.K., I didn’t realize that the word ‘president’ was in front of your last name, Stephen, because if it was, if ‘president’ was in front of your last name, my chances would be less than zero.’ I said, ‘But the guy who has ‘president’ in front of his last name, I kind of have 100 percent. Now what do you want to do? Do you want to continue to fight with me, because we can fight all day and all night now that I’m in the White House with you? Or we can declare peace and work alongside each other to help the president with his agenda. What do you want to do?’”</p>\n<p>Bannon tried to convince Scaramucci that he wasn’t up to the job. “He says to me, ‘You’re not equipped. This Russia thing, you won’t know how to handle it properly, you won’t know how to communicate it. Reince and I want to offer you a number of different jobs. Come and see us at 9:30 in the morning in the chief of staff’s office.’</p>\n<p>“I tell Bannon, ‘O.K. I’m happy to go see you at 9:30.’ I go to the White House&#8212;I have my badge. I go upstairs and say hello to Ivanka. [She says,] ‘Are you ready?’ I say, ‘I’m totally ready, no problem.’ I go downstairs. I have a 30-minute meeting with Reince and Bannon. And Priebus is now, he’s pulling the <em>Howdy Doody,</em> Richie Cunningham delivery and ‘Oh golly gee shucks, we’re friends.’ I’m like, ‘Reince, we can spare the ceremony. I know that you dislike me. I now dislike you. You can spare the ceremony.’ I said, ‘I’m looking at the two of you jamokes. If my network took a shit it would be the combination of the two of you. I’m very, very frustrated with the two of you, I’m going to tell you right now.’”</p>\n<p>At 10 A.M. on July 21, they headed into the Oval Office to see Trump. “He’s hot. Jared is in the office, Ivanka, me, <strong>Sarah [Huckabee Sanders]</strong>, <strong>Hope [Hicks]</strong>, and the two jamokes. The president is hot. He says, ‘Scaramucci is going to come in, he’s going to be the comms director.’ He’s dictating a press release to Sarah who is writing it all down, and then he turns to Priebus and he says, ‘I don’t want him reporting to you. He’s going to report directly to me. I don’t want him tainted with your stench. I know the two of you guys have been leaking on me and leaking on other people in the administration, and I want it to stop, and this guy’s in charge now. He’s going to fix the Comms Department; he’s going to fire the leakers.’ They are now super pissed. They walk out. I go the other way with Sarah, and then Sarah’s as white as a ghost. I’m getting the stern looks of anger and hatred from <strong>Sean Spicer.</strong> I’m like, ‘I don’t know why you’re looking at me like that for. If you want to work with me that’s great, and if you don’t that’s fine too.’ He goes into the president’s office and he resigns. He comes back and he announces that he’s resigned, and I said, ‘O.K., that’s great.’ Trump’s irritated. He says, ‘These guys are unbelievable. I gave them the job of a lifetime, they’re letting everybody down. They’re letting me down.’” (Spicer could not be reached for comment.)</p>\n<div class=\"embed cneembed\"><div class=\"embed block cneembed\" data-url=\"//player.cnevids.com/script/video/59834455be1034053500000d.js?muted=1\"></div></div></section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>The Mooch took a deep breath, and then reflected back on his days in the White House&#8212;11, according to his math, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2017/08/01/540793643/6-remarkable-accomplishments-of-anthony-scaramuccis-10-days-in-the-white-house\">rather than 10</a>, as many in the media had reported. “Now I told Colbert I thought I’d last longer than a carton of milk in your refrigerator,” he said. “But if you called me on July 22, that Saturday, and said, ‘Mooch, what’s happening here?’ I would have turned to you&#8212;and this is not revisionist history by the way, this is me literally saying it during that period of time&#8212;I would have said, ‘This is going to be very difficult because I’ve got the chief of staff and the chief strategist, they hate my guts. They’re now dumping on me in the press, they’re dumping anything that they can find. So I go back in to see the president. We agree that Sarah is going to be the press secretary. He then turns to Sarah and says, ‘Let Anthony do the press conference today. You O.K., you comfortable doing the press conference?’ I said, ‘Yeah, no problem, sir.’ [Trump says,] ‘O.K., what time is the press conference?’ [The Mooch replied,] ‘It’s at two o’clock.’ We were a little delayed.</p>\n<p>“So now I walk back into the press secretary’s office,” he continued, “and the entire comm staff is there. I say, ‘Listen, there’s a lot of leaks going on. I don’t know who’s doing the leaking, but if you give me two or three weeks, I’ll be able to figure it out, and if you’re doing the leaking you’re going to get fired.’ They then turned to me and said, ‘O.K., great, do you want a briefing for the press room?’ I said, ‘What do you mean?’ They said, ‘Well you’re going to be in front of 250 members of the press and do you want a briefing on Iraq and a briefing on Afghanistan and a briefing on Korea, and a briefing on this and a briefing on that?’ I looked at all of them and I said, ‘Absolutely not.’ They looked at me very puzzled and I said, ‘Listen, I don’t want a briefing, all that’ll do is confuse me. Let me go up there and let me talk to these people the way I’m capable of and we’ll see what happens. Thank you, guys, class dismissed. Let’s go.’</p>\n<p>“So I give the press conference and millions of people see it and it’s all over the world,” he continued. “I get out of the room, I walk through the Oval into the study, and the president’s got a 60-inch flat screen in his study. He’s got the DirectTV D.V.R. control in his hand, he’s going back and forth looking at the thing. He looks over at me, he looks over at the naval aide, and he turns to the naval aide and he says, ‘Tell Anthony what you just told me.’ The naval aide looks to me and he says, ‘Sir, I just told the president that I’ve never seen anybody give a press conference like that and that this guy is going to really help you, sir. He’s got the goods. He’s going to really help.’ So I shook his hand. I said, ‘That’s awesome.’ I said, ‘Mr. President, I hope I can do the job, but you’ve got to know knives are out for me. Those two guys are shitting in their pants.’ He said, ‘Yeah, let them shit in their pants. Don’t worry about it. You’ll be fine, you’ll be fine.’”</p>\n<p>Scaramucci thought his first press conference went well. “I’m Italian,” he said. “I like using the word ‘love’”&#8212;he used it six times about Trump in that first press conference&#8212;“people got upset about that, right? I’m a grown man. I love the president. I say the words. I love everybody. You know what I mean? What do you want me to do? That’s my personality. O.K. I’m aware of my flaws. I write about them pretty honestly in these books I’ve written, right?”</p>\n<div class=\"callout large has-pullquote\" data-type=\"callout\"><div class=\"embed pullquote\" data-type=\"pullquote\"><span><blockquote>\n<p>“I’m like, ‘Reince, we can spare the ceremony.

When the Mooch saw Lizza’s tweet, he was pissed because that meant to him that the White House leaks were still occurring. He called Lizza at home to ask who had leaked to him. It was a friendly enough call, the Mooch thought, but it would soon be his undoing. “So now Ryan Lizza,” he said. “His father, <strong>Frank,</strong> and my father go back 50 years, 51 now, 1967. They know each other from the Long Island construction world. I meet Ryan Lizza on a sound stage at CNN, ‘Hey, are you related to Frank Lizza?’ ‘Frank’s my father.’ ‘Terrific. You grew up on Oyster Bay? Great.’ Long Island Italian, Long Island Italian, fathers know each other for 50 years. My dad says they’re a terrific family. O.K., great. There’s my mistake right there. So if Ryan Lizza says, ‘Oh, I really didn’t know Anthony,’ that is true. I cede that point to him. But if he says he wasn’t trying to build a relationship with me and he wasn’t trying to make me into one of his sources, now he’s lying.” (In an e-mail, Lizza said he’d “never heard” of Scaramucci or his father “until I met him at CNN one night last year.”) “So now I call him because he’s got this story from my boy Reince,” Scaramucci continued. “I’m teasing [Ryan]. You can listen to the tape, ‘Hey, man. O.K., O.K. Who told you that? Break it down. Tell me who told you that.’ ‘Oh, Anthony, ha-ha. I’ve got to protect my sources.’ ‘I know. I’m just breaking your balls. But I don’t understand. The leaking has really got to stop here. We’ve got to figure out a way to stop the leaking. I’m sure Priebus told you that.’ ‘What do you think of Priebus?’ ‘He’s a paranoid schizophrenic.’ Of course I used the f-bomb a few times. I’m prone to do that . . . And I’m making some jokes and I’m playing for laughs, because that’s my personality.</p>\n<p>“Do I think I’m being recorded?” he continued. “I do not. That’s my mistake. Do I think the conversation was off the record? A hundred percent I do. Do I say that it’s off the record? I don’t, but I feel that I have a personal rapport with a human being, and inside the spirit of human relations, journalists and their sources know what’s on and off the record . . . In a later call I said, ‘Listen, call <strong>David Remnick</strong> [the editor of <em>The New Yorker</em>] and yourself, and let’s have an agreement here that you’re not gonna publish this story. I’ll get you 10 other stories. We’ll work on a deal. I’ll fly you around on Air Force One. This is unfair to me. It’s completely and totally off the record.’”</p>\n<p>But Lizza wouldn’t go for that deal. “No,” he told Scaramucci. “Me and David have already talked. I’m just giving you the heads-up that we’re publishing this story.” (Lizza said in his e-mail to me that in his audio recording of this second conversation with Scaramucci, there are no offers of “10 other stories” or “rides on Air Force One.” He added, “I’m afraid that as with so much that comes out of his mouth, this is another lie.”)</p>\n<p>At first, according to Scaramucci, Trump liked what he had said to Lizza. He got off on all that macho bravado. He liked that there was both the Harvard Law School Scaramucci and the Long Island Mooch. And he told Scaramucci so. He was laughing about it. Scaramucci blamed Steve Bannon for blowing the embers into a conflagration by calling <strong>Mark Meadows</strong> of the Freedom Caucus. “He’s like, ‘You guys are evangelicals. You don’t like profanity,’ and he’s trying to stir these guys up. They still think he’s big and powerful. He’s asking them to call the president and rail on me for using the profanity. And they do that. So now my support is weakening, but I’m still fine with the president.” (Meadows did not respond to a request for comment; a source close to Bannon maintains he never made such a call.)</p>\n<p>On July 28, Priebus was pushed out of his job at the White House. <strong>John Kelly</strong> replaced him as Trump’s chief of staff. “Nine minutes later, the <em>New York Post</em> is out with a story that my wife is divorcing me because she hates Trump,” Scaramucci said. He continued, “Literally, without exaggeration, it’s 10 minutes later.” (Actually, it was 28 minutes later, and&#8212;good news&#8212;the Mooch and his wife are back together as a couple now.)</p>\n<p>For about the next 48 hours&#8212;after Priebus had been fired and until Kelly fired him&#8212;there was no doubt inside the Beltway that Scaramucci was a very powerful guy. Spicer and Priebus were gone. He had sandblasted Bannon, and it was clear enough that Bannon’s days were numbered. And Scaramucci still had Trump’s support, despite the profanity-laced Lizza blockbuster. “On that Saturday morning I’m on the phone with the president,” Scaramucci said. “He says, ‘O.K. You’re a lucky bastard. You’re out of the news cycle now because Priebus’s firing is in the news cycle. I’ll see you Monday at eight.’ I say, ‘O.K., great.’”</p>\n<p>In the warped time and space of Washington, Scaramucci could tell the arc of political power was starting to bend in his direction. “Just by the way people who were calling me Friday night, Saturday, into Sunday morning,” he said. “People in the West Wing and the way they were calling me, I knew that they were like, ‘Holy shit. Trump means business with Scaramucci, and it looks like Scaramucci means business. He’s one week in the job and he’s blown Priebus into Pennsylvania Avenue. He’s mortally wounded Bannon. Bannon’s not gonna recover from that.’”</p>\n<p>But then things began to change rapidly for the Mooch. He started feeling a different kind of Washington wind, a distinctly chilly one. “By late Sunday, I’m getting a feeling that I’m gonna get fired,” he said. “The perception is that I’m powerful, and what I call the swamp-like operatives that are working inside of the White House are now turning towards me and being somewhat obsequious, and if I’m less self-observant, maybe I would buy into that, but I’m not. I’m very self-observant. I say, ‘O.K. These sons of bitches that were ignoring me six months ago are now, Holy fuck. Power’s coming to this guy. I better start being nice to this guy.’ You know what I mean?”</p>\n<p>But that began to change on Sunday afternoon. “My bones are telling me I’m gonna get fired because I e-mail a few people,” he said. “The obsequiousness starts at six P.M. on Friday and it ends at about one, two in the afternoon on Sunday. So now I’m like, ‘O.K.’ I just could feel it, less interaction on text, less e-mail interaction, less phone interaction. Now I’m feeling, ‘O.K., if I can survive Monday morning, I‘m gonna go dark. Mission accomplished on Priebus, got to get to Bannon. I’m gonna go dark and not do any press, any interviews, or any of that other stuff.’ And I’m getting hit by the guys inside [that] I’m addicted to the press and all this other stuff.”</p>\n<div class=\"callout large has-pullquote\" data-type=\"callout\"><div class=\"embed pullquote\" data-type=\"pullquote\"><span><blockquote>\n<p>“You want to talk about the education of Anthony Scaramucci?

Monday morning, he said he knew by 7:14 A.M. that he had been fired. “How do I know at 7:14 on Monday that I’m getting fired?” he said. “<strong>Nick Ayers,</strong> who is now the new chief of staff for <strong>Vice President Pence,</strong> is trying to reach me on the White House bat phone. I had been issued an encrypted phone. When you’re talking to the president or the vice president or people inside the West Wing, you do not use your personal cell phone. You’re issued a White House-encrypted cell phone. O.K., no problem. I’ve got the White House-encrypted cell phone. Nick Ayers is texting me on my regular phone, saying, in effect, ‘Hey, Mooch, why aren’t you answering the White House-encrypted bat phone?’ ‘O.K., let me turn it on.’ I turn it on. It’s inoperable. There’s no e-mail and there’s no cell service. They’ve disconnected my phone. Now I know I’m getting fired, but I’m just waiting for it. You know what I mean?” (Ayers did not respond to a request for comment.)</p>\n<p>He was sitting in his small White House office when he got invited to Kelly’s swearing-in as the new chief of staff. “They swear in the chief of staff,” he said. “They’re sitting in those two chairs, the president and Kelly. They’re doing photos. Then the Cabinet meeting starts. I’m getting ready for the Cabinet meeting. I go back to my desk. Kelly’s assistant comes in, ‘Chief of Staff Kelly would like to see you.’ I walk in. I was thinking that I’m not gonna go to the Cabinet meeting, because if I’m fired and it’s still Priebus’s White House&#8212;and this was the irony of the day, the thing does not leak. But if it’s Priebus’s White House, every journalist now knows that I’ve been fired. But it’s not Priebus’s White House anymore. It is actually John Kelly’s White House. And guess what? The thing doesn’t leak. Kelly’s first act is he calls me into his office and says, ‘I need to let you go.’”</p>\n<p>“Wow,” the Mooch told him. “That’s super disappointing.”</p>\n<p>“You know you made a huge mistake last week and these words that you used, which they recorded and got you on tape, you’ll never recover from that,” Kelly replied. “I know this town. I’ve lived in this town a long time, and you’ll never recover from it.”</p>\n<p>Scaramucci wasn’t so sure. “I think this town is a lot different today,” he said. “The president recovered from remarks. I know I’m not the president, but if you give me a chance, I’ve put a whole comms plan together,” showing Kelly the document he had in his hand.</p>\n<p>“I’m really sorry,” Kelly told him. “I have the full authority of the president. I’m sure you’re gonna want to go in and see him, but you need to know that you don’t need to do that. Him and I spoke about this, and this is our mutual decision.”</p>\n<p>“No, I wouldn’t do that to you, sir,” the Mooch replied. “You’re the chief of staff. If you don’t want me here, no sense in me being here. I’m not gonna go around you to the president.”</p>\n<p>A White House personnel guy then showed up. “He’s like, ‘Thank you so much for helping us here. Priebus was a disaster.’ I said, ‘No problem.’ He says, ‘If you’re O.K. with it, I have to escort you out.’ I said, ‘Absolutely. No problem. If you don’t mind, because I’m so high-profile at this point, I’d like to go out the East Wing exit, over by Treasury. Are you cool with that?’”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, no problem,” he said. “That’s fine, Mooch, no problem.”</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>The Mooch told me that while it was “very painful” going through it, after six months “on the other side of it,” he thinks it was “an unbelievably phenomenal experience.” He continued, “You want to talk about the education of Anthony Scaramucci? I learned that the swamp is probably a gold-plated cesspool with no drain. You understand what I’m saying? You can’t drain the fucking thing. It’s a gold-plated cesspool, and you got cesspool operators in there that know how to slow down disruptors like Donald Trump.” (He cited as but one example the fact that the sale of SkyBridge to HNA and RON has still not been approved by the federal government.)</p>\n<p>He said that one Trump tweet more than any other sums up the man: “My button is bigger than your button.” He said, “If you really know the guy and you know how he’s raking it over everybody and breaking everybody’s balls, it’s like laugh-out-loud funny.”</p>\n<p>The Mooch’s tumultuous days did not alter his perception of Donald Trump. “My point is this guy’s a winner,” he said, warming to his subject. “He’s been winning his whole life, and he’s not a choke artist. He’ll hit the shot.” Then he was fully taken with his reverie. “The shot’s going in,” he continued. “<strong>Michael Jordan,</strong> that last shot in the championship, he wanted the ball. That’s Trump.” Somewhere, an orange-hued president is nodding enthusiastically.</p>\n</section>","channel":"News","subChannel":"Politics","tags":["anthony scaramucci","steve bannon","donald trump","reince priebus"],"ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"dek":"Steve Bannon is the ultimate swamp creature, Reince Priebus acts like Richie Cunningham, Donald Trump is like Michael Jordan, and other observations of Anthony Scaramucci.","seoTitle":"“F---ing Sith Lord,” “Horrific Leakers,” and “Berserkazoid Craziness”: The Mooch Recalls His Brief Shining Fortnight at the Center of American Politics","seoDescription":"Steve Bannon is the ultimate swamp creature, Reince Priebus acts like Richie Cunningham, Donald Trump is like Michael Jordan, and other observations of Anthony Scaramucci.","socialTitle":"“Berserkazoid Craziness”: The Mooch Recalls His 10 Days in the Swamp","socialDescription":"In a series of epic interviews, Anthony Scaramucci describes his brief shining moment at the center of American politics.","issueDate":"","rubric":"Scaramucci","promoHed":"“Berserkazoid Craziness”: The Mooch Recalls His 10 Days in the Swamp","promoDek":"In a series of epic interviews, Anthony Scaramucci describes his brief shining moment at the center of American politics.","id":"5a738a344b74720a0b1c70c8","revision":105,"createdAt":"February 1, 2018 4:44 pm","modifiedAt":"February 1, 2018 7:43 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"February 1, 2018 7:43 pm","_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Lauren Jones","filename":"t-the-mooch-interview-illustration-sam-hadley.jpg","aspectRatios":{"3:2":{"width":1998,"height":1332,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1332,"width":1998,"x":1,"y":0}},"duration":null},"5:3":{"width":2000,"height":1200,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1200,"width":2000,"x":0,"y":0}},"duration":null},"2:3":{"width":848,"height":1272,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":648,"y":41,"height":1272,"width":848}},"duration":null},"9:16":{"width":724,"height":1288,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":688,"y":35,"height":1288,"width":724}},"duration":null},"7:3":{"width":1994,"height":854,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":0,"y":328,"height":854,"width":1994}},"duration":null},"16:9":{"width":2000,"height":1125,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":0,"y":168,"height":1125,"width":2000}},"duration":null},"4:3":{"width":1775,"height":1331,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":129,"y":0,"height":1331,"width":1775}},"duration":null},"1:1":{"width":1248,"height":1248,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":400,"y":39,"height":1248,"width":1248}},"duration":null},"master":{"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2018/02/01/5a738df3bb83327dfc726ea1_t-the-mooch-interview-illustration-sam-hadley.jpg","width":2000,"height":1333,"duration":null}},"title":"t-the-mooch-interview-illustration-sam-hadley.jpg","cropMode":"TOP","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":true,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":false},"restrictCropping":false,"id":"5a738df3bb83327dfc726ea2","revision":4,"createdAt":"February 1, 2018 5:00 pm","modifiedAt":"February 1, 2018 5:31 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"February 1, 2018 5:31 pm","credit":"Illustration by Sam Hadley.","tags":[],"altText":"","modelName":"photo","collection":"photos"}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"name":"William D.

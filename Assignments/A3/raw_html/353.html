Unfortunately, emergency management is never taken seriously in our country which leaves most of our citizens helpless in any accident or medical emergency. In many cases, basic first aid can keep victims alive till proper medical aid reaches them. Dr Kishalay Datta of Max Healthcare says, “As an emergency department veteran doctor, I see accident victims coming in every day. It saddens me to see that most road accident victims die because they do not get timely first aid.” In a bid to put an end to such deaths, Dr Datta has mobilised a petition to The Ministry of Road Transportation and Highways, Delhi Transport Department and Ministry of Health and Family Welfare demanding that First Aid Training be mandatory for all driving license applicants.</p><p><strong>Sign the petition</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/make-first-aid-training-mandatory-for-all-driving-license-applicants-everyminutematters\"><ins><strong>Make First Aid Training mandatory for all driving license applicants. #EveryMinuteMatters</strong></ins></a></p><p>Nearly 70,000 road deaths in India can be prevented if victims receive timely medical aid from bystanders. Last year, nearly 37% of the total accidents took place on traffic junctions and a majority of them happened on uncontrolled junctions. This only underscores the importance of bystanders in case of an accident.</p><p>What also inspired Dr Datta to start this petition are the life stories of Traffic Queen and Traffic Baba, two unsung heroes who worked in their own capacity to make Indian roads safer. Dorris Francis earned the moniker Traffic Queen after she found her life’s mission in a personal tragedy. A road accident in 2008 left her daughter with severely damaged lungs and the girl died after months of suffering. Ever since, Francis used to station herself at a crossing close to where the accident had taken place and manage traffic for four hours in the morning. She did this until she herself was diagnosed with ovarian cancer.</p>"},{"description":"","image-metadata":{"width":1024,"height":576,"mime-type":"image/jpeg","focus-point":null},"page-url":"/story/9791b677-0a06-4c89-89d1-9862987d92fe/element/0779ca9d-50ce-4a36-bdc2-38e70e54f2ec","type":"image","family-id":"da88bf67-5c81-42d1-9de7-29ef155ecffc","image-attribution":"(Photo: Collect India Facebook page)","title":"Dorris Francis found her life’s mission in a tragedy.","id":"0779ca9d-50ce-4a36-bdc2-38e70e54f2ec","image-s3-key":"thequint/2018-02/4b153a90-6fb1-4679-81f9-0abc0b2e11ac/78b275e3-10d2-42f2-bc8d-4f2e1b248bc2.jpg","metadata":{},"subtype":null},{"description":"","page-url":"/story/9791b677-0a06-4c89-89d1-9862987d92fe/element/793856b9-ad86-4e1f-981e-d49e5caf0091","type":"text","family-id":"2fea22da-5ed3-4917-b242-7b6cb6bb0740","title":"","id":"793856b9-ad86-4e1f-981e-d49e5caf0091","metadata":{},"subtype":null,"text":"<p>Max Healthcare Emergency Teams’ commitment to reducing road deaths doesn’t stop at the petition.

The story goes that out of their 14 years in exile, Ram, Sita and Laxman spent 11 of them in the forests of Chitrakoot. This should give you a fair idea of the importance of this town in the Ramayan. Visiting Chitrakoot is like almost like turning through the pages of this enigmatic epic.</p><p>The town is also said to have been the meditation site of many legendary sages and has been a regular feature in Indian folklore. The holy trinity of Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh are believed to have taken their incarnation in Chitrakoot. No wonder then this town has great religious and mythological significance and is rightly known as the ‘Place of many wonders’. Chitrakoot falls in the northern Vindhya Range of mountains and it’s believed that the town gets its name from the Cheetal deer found in the region. If you’re visiting Madhya Pradesh and are looking for some much needed spiritual calm, head to this town and revel in all the fascinating stories it has to offer.</p><h2>What to see</h2><p>When in Chitrakoot, you’re never too far away from mythology and the Kamadgiri mountain is testimony to this. Believed to be wish-fulfilling, this bow-shaped hollow mountain has found mentions in many a legend. The story goes that before creating the universe, Lord Brahma performed a <em>havan</em> over here. So in many ways, this place is older than time itself.</p><p>That this town was the abode of Ram during his exile years is evidenced in the structures that stand even today. One visit to Chitrakoot and you will see how some of the chapters of the Ramayan simply come alive. The spot where Ram’s brother Bharat convinced him to come back to Ayodhya is called Bharat Milap and a temple stands there today. It’s said that the footprints you see inside the temple are those of Ram and his brothers. Param Kutir was the cottage that Laxman had built for Ram and Sita. Now you have a temple at the same site.</p>"},{"description":"","embed-js":"PGlmcmFtZSBzdHlsZT0naGVpZ2h0OjYzOHB4OycgY2xhc3M9J3F1aXotaWZyYW1lJyBzcmM9J2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlcXVpbnQuaGVyb2t1YXBwLmNvbS9xdWludGxhYi9zd2l0Y2gvP3g9aHR0cHM6Ly9xdWludHlwZS1kcm9wYm94LnMzLWFjY2VsZXJhdGUuYW1hem9uYXdzLmNvbS90aGVxdWludC5xdWludHlwZS5jb20vMjAxOC0wMS0yMC8xODA0L0JoYXJhdC1NaWxhcC1hZnRlcigyKS5qcGcmeT1odHRwczovL3F1aW50eXBlLWRyb3Bib3guczMtYWNjZWxlcmF0ZS5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tL3RoZXF1aW50LnF1aW50eXBlLmNvbS8yMDE4LTAxLTIwLzExMTUvQmhhcmF0LU1pbGFwLWJlZm9yZSgxKS5qcGcmY2FwMT1DbGljayBoZXJlIHRvIHNlZSBCaGFyYXQgTWlsYXAgY29tZSBhbGl2ZSZjYXAyPUJoYXJhdCBNaWxhcCBsaXRlcmFsbHkgdHJhbnNsYXRlcyB0byBNZWV0aW5nIHdpdGggQmhhcmF0LiBJdCBnb3QgdGhpcyBuYW1lIGJlY2F1c2UgaGVyZSBpcyB3aGVyZSBSYW0gbWV0IGhpcyBicm90aGVyIEJoYXJhdCB3aG8gd2FudGVkIGhpbSB0byByZXR1cm4gdG8gQXlvZGh5YS4nIHdpZHRoPScxMDAlJyBmcmFtZWJvcmRlcj0nMCc+PC9pZnJhbWU+","page-url":"/story/eb861cc8-b31f-4f17-bee5-0eba28a839d7/element/e2b99a23-bfe5-48f5-90c5-2f1b9f6c6b51","type":"jsembed","family-id":"642c51df-ed9e-490a-9472-47537b3f3284","title":"","id":"e2b99a23-bfe5-48f5-90c5-2f1b9f6c6b51","metadata":{},"subtype":null},{"description":"","page-url":"/story/eb861cc8-b31f-4f17-bee5-0eba28a839d7/element/d02c7be9-5eb6-4763-8c00-d3b3e4fd809e","type":"text","family-id":"98e7f3f0-575e-46e9-ae71-958f8022d3e6","title":"","id":"d02c7be9-5eb6-4763-8c00-d3b3e4fd809e","metadata":{},"subtype":null,"text":"<p>Ram Ghat, located on the banks of river Mandakini, is considered to be very auspicious. Devotees congregate here in the belief that they will be absolved of their sins. The water body that was Sita’s bathing place during the exile period is today known as Janki Kund. For the uninitiated, Janki is another name for Sita. It comes from the name of her adoptive father Janak.</p>"},{"description":"","embed-js":"PGlmcmFtZSBzdHlsZT0naGVpZ2h0OjYzOHB4OycgY2xhc3M9J3F1aXotaWZyYW1lJyBzcmM9J2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlcXVpbnQuaGVyb2t1YXBwLmNvbS9xdWludGxhYi9zd2l0Y2gvP3g9aHR0cHM6Ly9xdWludHlwZS1kcm9wYm94LnMzLWFjY2VsZXJhdGUuYW1hem9uYXdzLmNvbS90aGVxdWludC5xdWludHlwZS5jb20vMjAxOC0wMS0yMC8xNDE3L2MtamFua2lrdW5kLTIuanBnJnk9aHR0cHM6Ly9xdWludHlwZS1kcm9wYm94LnMzLWFjY2VsZXJhdGUuYW1hem9uYXdzLmNvbS90aGVxdWludC5xdWludHlwZS5jb20vMjAxOC0wMS0yMC8xNjEwL2MtamFua2lrdW5kLTEuanBnJmNhcDE9Q2xpY2sgaGVyZSB0byBzZWUgSmFua2kgS3VuZCBjb21lIGFsaXZlJmNhcDI9SmFua2kgaXMgYW5vdGhlciBuYW1lIGZvciBTaXRhIGFuZCBKYW5raSBLdW5kIGlzIGJlbGlldmVkIHRvIGhhdmUgYmVlbiBoZXIgYmF0aGluZyBwbGFjZSB3aGVuIHNoZSB3YXMgaW4gZXhpbGUgd2l0aCBSYW0uJyB3aWR0aD0nMTAwJScgZnJhbWVib3JkZXI9JzAnPjwvaWZyYW1lPg==","page-url":"/story/eb861cc8-b31f-4f17-bee5-0eba28a839d7/element/ea1ab287-94b1-47b3-b45f-55b6d2b0f9a2","type":"jsembed","family-id":"3667f5ab-3806-47c5-8147-3d9b3ec41265","title":"","id":"ea1ab287-94b1-47b3-b45f-55b6d2b0f9a2","metadata":{},"subtype":null},{"description":"","page-url":"/story/eb861cc8-b31f-4f17-bee5-0eba28a839d7/element/32de6b9e-8308-473e-bf47-0e09197c45ae","type":"text","family-id":"699459c3-e00d-4331-a22e-66d845992048","title":"","id":"32de6b9e-8308-473e-bf47-0e09197c45ae","metadata":{},"subtype":null,"text":"<p>The caves of Gupt Godavari are nothing short of a marvel.

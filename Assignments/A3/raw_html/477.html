However, this year, there is tension in the air due to the presence of North Korea. In attendance to represent the country was Kim Jong-un's sister, Kim Yo-jong. Things remained even more awkward as she sat next to the Vice President of the United States, Mike Pence. Viewers could not handle the strain, and <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/kim-yo-jong-north-korean-delegation-arrive-olympics/story?id=52957261" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweets about Kim Jong-un's sister's face at the Olympics</a> are too good.</p><p>North Korea in attendance at the Olympics is a big deal. Kim Yo-jung, the youngest sister to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, along with other members of North Korea's government arrived in PyeongChang via Kim Jong-un's private jet on Feb. 9. According to ABC, their arrival was a giant topic of conversation around the country (and world) and "was broadcast live on South Korean TV."</p><p>This year's Olympics brought a lot of firsts. Kim's arrival wasn't just a powerful image for the games, but for the relationship between North and South Korea. Stepping foot off the big white jet marked Kim as the <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/kim-yo-jong-north-korean-delegation-arrive-olympics/story?id=52957261" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first person from the "Kim Dynasty</a> to step on South Korean lands since the end of the Korean War in 1953."</p><p>We did see Kim smile at the games during the entrance of North and South Korea and while talking to the South's unification minister. This shows that some things do make her happy. However, she clearly DGAF about Mike Pence or the USA's entrance... and has the side eye to prove it. </p><p>Twitter can't stop making jokes about <a href="https://www.elitedaily.com/p/heres-why-north-korea-south-korea-walked-together-at-the-2018-olympics-opening-ceremony-8153971">Kim's unimpressed face during the Olympics</a>.</p><div class="cP"><div class="cM"><div class="cQ" style="padding-top:30%"></div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/ajr7004/status/962156924237176833"></a></blockquote><script src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async></script></div></div><div class="cP"><div class="cM"><div class="cQ" style="padding-top:30%"></div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/IAmMissTLC/status/962150011130863618"></a></blockquote><script src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async></script></div></div><div class="cP"><div class="cM"><div class="cQ" style="padding-top:30%"></div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/BethCStuart/status/962149043890659328"></a></blockquote><script src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async></script></div></div><div class="cP"><div class="cM"><div class="cQ" style="padding-top:30%"></div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/kathyasheton/status/962150376337215488"></a></blockquote><script src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async></script></div></div><div class="cP"><div class="cM"><div class="cQ" style="padding-top:30%"></div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/SisterLawna/status/962163506765336576"></a></blockquote><script src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async></script></div></div><div class="cP"><div class="cM"><div class="cQ" style="padding-top:30%"></div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/zacayoung/status/962160009030365184"></a></blockquote><script src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async></script></div></div><div class="cP"><div class="cM"><div class="cQ" style="padding-top:30%"></div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/ARLYNVM28/status/962148822104330240"></a></blockquote><script src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async></script></div></div><p>The side-eye is a big deal because of the tensions between North Korea and the United States over the past few months.

The alarming suspicions are that Â <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/16/politics/tillerson-north-korea-vancouver/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">North Korea is using the PyeongChang Olympics to buy time</a> to advance their weapons programs. </p><p>U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said of America's relationship with the communist country, "The pressure campaign will continue until North Korea takes decisive steps to de-nuclearize." Tillerson also added, "We cannot be complacent."</p><p>Japan, Canada, and the United Kingdom were also in attendance at the summit. Japanese Foreign Minister, Taro Kono, articulated his mistrust when he said, </p><aside>I believe that North Korea wants to buy some time to continue their nuclear and missile programs. It's not the time to ease pressure towards North Korea.</aside><p>On the other hand, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Lu Kang, believes that immediately criticizing North Korea could lead to more problems and uncertainty. He said,</p><aside>[Such thinking] will only lead to split in the international community and harm the joint efforts that could properly solve the nuclear issue on Korea peninsula.</aside><p>Overall, no one is certain about North Korea's alternatives. The goal is to ease tensions and ultimately denuclearize North Korea.

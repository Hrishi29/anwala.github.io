no matter how many articles make note of these habits, or try to lampoon them, he&#39;s not giving them up. As I enter his office and take a seat at the opposite side of his desk&#8212;I don&#39;t offer a handshake, nor does he&#8212;he immediately hands me a sheet of paper. “Okay, that&#39;s for you,” he says warmly. “Nice poll. Just came out.” Between us, lined up along the front of his desk, are stacks of all of the recent magazines with his face on the cover&#8212;<em>Rolling Stone, Time, People, Newsweek, New York,</em> multiple copies of each, as though as an additional sideline he has opened the world&#39;s most narrowly focused newsstand.\n<p>As I settle in, his 27-year-old communications director, Hope Hicks, informs him that an article they have been expecting for a while about his time in military school has just been published.</p>\n<p>“Good or bad?” he asks.</p>\n<p>“Great,” she says.</p>\n<p>“ ‘Good athlete,’ all that stuff?” he checks.</p>\n<p>“ ‘Best athlete’…‘ladies’ man&#39;…,” she says.</p>\n<p>“Really?” he says, clearly pleased.</p>\n<p>“…‘best student’…,” she continues.</p>\n<p>“Yeah, I was a great student,” he says in a meditative tone. “I was good at everything.”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, that&#39;s what they said,” she confirms.</p>\n<p>He asks her to give a copy to me. (As it happens, I&#39;ve already read it online this morning; Ms. Hicks&#39;s summary is accurate.) “That&#39;s nice, huh?” he muses, and tells her he needs to write to his old classmates. “I heard they have some really nice quotes, and I haven&#39;t seen them in a long time.” He turns to me. “We get older, Chris, right? That&#39;s the bad part.”</p>\n<p>I entered the room using a cane, and he now asks, quite kindly and gently, a few questions about my problematic ankle. I tell him that it&#39;s pretty much fine now, though not what it once was.</p>\n<p>“Well, hey, what is?” he says. “Anyway, go ahead.”</p>\n<p>The conversation that follows&#8212;he makes clear at several points&#8212;isn&#39;t always to Trump&#39;s liking. At times I think his affront may be tactical, a way to better control the situation, but just as often he seems genuinely perplexed and annoyed that someone like him, a nice guy who is trying to give his best to the American people and who is riding high in every early poll, who is giving up his Monday lunchtime to share his considerable charm, should be asked to explain himself like this. In these moments, I have to remind myself of the remarkable and extensive catalog of incendiary comments he has made, and positions he has taken, as he has blitzkrieged the ill-prepared and undefended barricades of the American political process.</p>\n<p>But I start by discussing a small personal peculiarity.</p>\n<p><strong>GQ: You don&#39;t shake hands, do you? (1)</strong><br>\n<strong>DONALD TRUMP:</strong> Oh yeah, no, I do shake hands. Well, I&#39;ve been saying, and it&#39;s been borne out…if you have a cold, you pass the cold along to other people, or a flu. But no, I shake hands very gladly politically. I don&#39;t think you could be a politician if you didn&#39;t shake hands. Can you imagine if I refused to shake anybody&#39;s hands? <em>[“No,” chimes in Ms. Hicks, who will be remaining here for our interview.]</em> No&#8212;bottom line, I shake hands.</p>\n<p><strong>But if you go the whole way, you&#39;re going to have to touch a lot of dirty hands between now and next November.</strong><br>\nI&#39;ve been doing it. <em>[Ms. Hicks: “He&#39;s been doing it. Thirty thousand people at a rally the other week&#8212;he shook a lot of hands.”]</em> I&#39;ve been shaking thousands and thousands of hands on a daily basis, actually.</p>\n<p><strong>Does it make you shiver a little bit inside?</strong><br>\nNo, it&#39;s part of what I have to do to make America great again.</p>\n<p><strong>Are you having fun?</strong><br>\nI&#39;m having a good time. Because of the success of it, perhaps. It makes it a lot easier than some people that are not doing well. But I&#39;ve <em>really</em> enjoyed it. I really have.</p>\n<p><strong>Many years ago you said, “The fun is in the getting, not the having,” and I guess some people wonder whether that&#39;s your attitude toward the presidency.</strong><br>\nNo, actually in this case I don&#39;t think there&#39;s fun involved. It will be constant work to turn the country around because we have 50 million people on welfare, we have tremendous poverty levels at record numbers. We have almost a hundred million people out of work, out of the workforce. (2)</p>\n<p><strong>Putting it in the most basic way, there&#39;s a lot of people who really like you, but there&#39;s a lot of people who are deeply skeptical of your motives. Some people think it&#39;s a campaign driven by egotism, aimless ambition, and arrogance.</strong><br>\n<em>[slightly indignant half laugh]</em> This doesn&#39;t sound like a nice question! Look, I just have one thing in mind, and that&#39;s doing a great job for the country. Everybody has their detractors. Some people say arrogance, or whatever they may say. I only have one thing in mind and that&#39;s doing a great job for the country.</p>\n<p><strong>Whenever you explain why you&#39;d be a very fine president, a lot of what you say seems to boil down to: <em>Look, just shut up and trust me&#8212;I&#39;d be really good at this. I know I would.</em></strong><br>\nWell, I have been issuing a lot of policy over the last two-week period. But there is a certain amount of truth to that. I mean, I&#39;ve had tremendous success, and I&#39;ve just done it. And a lot of my supporters agree with that.</p>\n<p><strong>You&#39;ve broken many of the rules of how candidates usually act....</strong><br>\nThat&#39;s true. That, I agree with you. They say there&#39;s never been anything like this.</p>\n<p><strong>For instance, in recent times you&#39;ve referred to other people as: a loser, a total loser, a massive loser, grotesque, a moron, an obvious moron, a spoiled brat, a totally incompetent jerk, a stiff, a dummy, a bimbo, a clown, a low-class slob, a perv sleazebag, a major sleaze and buffoon, a spoiled brat without a properly functioning brain, a goofball atheist, a dope, a dummy dope, a dopey clown, a dog, and so on.</strong><br>\nWell, other people have said a lot of things about things, too. They&#39;ve said plenty of bad stuff.</p>\n<p><strong>But you&#39;ve got a vocabulary and an approach that&#39;s different.</strong><br>\nProbably. Probably that&#39;s why people are here, that&#39;s why I have this, you know. <em>[He gestures to the stacks of magazines lying between us.]</em> Every magazine cover. And maybe we&#39;ll have another. Are we gonna be the cover story, do you know? Or not? We should be, we should be. Based on merit, we should be. But we&#39;ll see. Not sure I want it. You&#39;re going to ask a positive question before the interview&#39;s over, right?</p>\n<p><strong>Well, I think the positive comes from the answer. Anyway, will you still talk like that if you&#39;re president?</strong><br>\nNo. Probably not.</p>\n<p><strong>Why not?</strong><br>\nDepends. It depends. I think probably I&#39;d be much different. I have a great capacity to be what I have to be, and as president you may want a different tone. But that&#39;s a highly competitive tone, and many of those expressions&#8212;not all, but many of those expressions&#8212;are highly descriptive. It&#39;s hard to find words to compete with them when talking about somebody. But no, I would imagine I would be quite a bit different. I would feel differently about things as a president. Right now, I&#39;m fighting a lot of people. As a president I would be more measured.</p>\n<p><strong>But part of your appeal, and part of what you&#39;re selling as your appeal, is that you&#39;re different. And if people are going to vote for you, surely they want the real Donald Trump to be the president?</strong><br>\nYeah, I would be. I wouldn&#39;t change much, but I think I would probably tone down the rhetoric, perhaps. And perhaps not. Depends on who it was that I was speaking about. We have some bad dudes out there.</p>\n<p><strong>If anyone attacks you, you bite back pretty hard, don&#39;t you?</strong><br>\nYes. Yes.</p>\n<p><strong>If you were the same kind of president as you are a candidate, it sometimes feels like the first time some country disrespected you, you&#39;d just want to nuke them.</strong><br>\nNo, no, no. But some of these countries are really taking advantage of us and I would fight for fairness of our country.</p>\n<p><strong>But would you be scared to nuke them if you thought it was justified?</strong><br>\nI wouldn&#39;t be nuking anybody.</p>\n<p><strong>Under any circumstances?</strong><br>\nUnder… I will have a military that&#39;s so strong and powerful, and so respected, we&#39;re not gonna have to nuke anybody.</p>\n<p><strong>So could we get rid of the weapons?</strong><br>\nNo, no, we wouldn&#39;t get rid of the weapons. Because you have so many people out there. But I would be somebody that would be amazingly calm under pressure.</p>\n<p><strong>But if you&#39;re not going to use them, what&#39;s the point in having them?</strong><br>\nThe fact that other people have them. And unfortunately gaining more and more.</p>\n<p><strong>But ultimately you have to be prepared to press the button or there&#39;s no point in having them?</strong><br>\nWell, I don&#39;t want to talk about that subject because that&#39;s not a subject that, you know… <em>[restarts his thought]</em> that has to do with that whole… <em>[restarts his thought again]</em> I just don&#39;t want to talk about it. It is highly, highly, highly, highly unlikely that I would ever be using them.</p>\n<p><strong>As you know, people ask a lot of questions about your attitude toward women. When you were asked on <em>The View</em> what your message was to women and you said you wanted to cherish them, protect them,</strong> take care of them&#8212;<br>\nAnd respect them, yes. I do respect them, I have great respect for women. In fact, one of the reasons <em>The Apprentice</em> was such a successful show for so many years, the audience of women was fantastic.</p>\n<p><strong>Sure, but that&#39;s an entertainment TV show.</strong><br>\nNo, but it&#39;s indicative. I have great respect for women, and I will do more for women than anybody because I get things done and I know how to do things. And I&#39;ll also keep this country safe and secure, which a politician probably won&#39;t, because they&#39;re weak and ineffective. They&#39;re weak, ineffective people, politicians.</p>\n<p><strong>What do you say to the women who respond: I&#39;m not that bothered about being “cherished” or “protected” or “taken care of,” I just want to be treated equally?</strong><br>\nI think you&#39;re being politically correct when you ask me a question like that. They do want to be taken care of and they do want to be cherished and they do want to be respected, and I think when you ask a question like that you&#39;re just trying to be politically correct, that&#39;s all. But that&#39;s okay.</p>\n<p><strong>You&#39;d never say you were going to “cherish” men, would you?</strong><br>\nI would. I would. I would cherish men. I cherish all people in their lives. I think it&#39;s very important. No, I would cherish men, I would cherish women&#8212;I want to take care of everybody.</p>\n<p><strong>Obviously another issue that some people have taken&#8212;</strong><br>\n<em>[interrupts]</em> Did anybody ever say anything positive about me? This is not looking... This is not looking good. So far I haven&#39;t been asked one positive question. But that&#39;s okay. Whatever. Whatever. <em>[exhales loudly through pursed lips]</em></p>\n<p><strong>People expect you to be asked tough questions, and you&#39;re certainly up to answering them.</strong><br>\nSure I am, but, I mean, you know, so far, in all fairness, you&#39;ve only asked me, like, really negative questions. Wow. I&#39;m saying, this article&#39;s going to be a disaster. <em>[Ms. Hicks: “I think we deserve the cover just for tolerating these questions.”]</em> It&#39;s all right. Whatever.</p>\n<p><strong>A similar issue that people are giving you a hard time about is race.</strong><br>\nI don&#39;t think so. Race? Nobody&#39;s giving me a hard time. I just won… I just had the highest percentage ever in a Republican primary&#8212;25 percent of the African-Americans supported me. (3) So I don&#39;t think you&#39;re right.</p>\n<p><strong>But certainly a lot of people have written, and some people suspect, that even if you&#39;re not racist yourself, you&#39;re consciously pandering to racist sentiments in parts of the electorate.</strong><br>\n<em>[Ms. Hicks to Trump: “Shall we wrap this up?”]</em> I&#39;ve never heard that. Yeah, well, I&#39;ve never heard that. No, I mean I am the least racist person that you have ever met.</p>\n<p><strong>Obviously there&#39;s a big movement, the Black Lives Matter movement…</strong><br>\nI don&#39;t know&#8212;is it a big movement? I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s big or if it&#39;s small.</p>\n<p><strong>What do you make of it?</strong><br>\nI don&#39;t make anything of it. I saw them steal the microphone from Bernie Sanders and he just yielded, which surprised me. But no, I don&#39;t know anything about… You know, when you say it&#39;s a big movement, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a big movement. You think it&#39;s a big movement?</p>\n<p><strong>It&#39;s very hard to quantify. It&#39;s certainly a loud movement. And I think it&#39;s an interesting and important idea.</strong><br>\nYou think it is, actually? Black lives matter? But do you think white lives matter?</p>\n<p><strong>Well, the more common response is for people to say “all lives matter,” though I understand why some people consider that kind of tone-deaf.</strong><br>\nTo me, all lives matter. All lives matter.</p>\n<p><strong>But can you see how people who are fighting to point out a particular injustice&#8212;</strong><br>\n<em>[interrupts]</em> No. No, I can&#39;t. I can&#39;t understand that term, no. I think that term is hurting them, not helping them.</p>\n<p><strong>As you know, there&#39;s a lot of chatter that if the going gets tough and you go down in the polls, people think you&#39;ll just quit.</strong><br>\nThere is? I haven&#39;t…</p>\n<p><strong>You tweeted about it yesterday. (4)</strong><br>\nYeah, I mean sure, but when you say a lot of chatter, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a lot of chatter. Let&#39;s put it this way: I&#39;m in this to win this. I&#39;m not in to play games, I&#39;m not in to come in second and have everybody say how brilliant I was, and how it was the Summer of Trump&#8212;and even now the Autumn of Trump, because I&#39;m doing very well still. The summer ended a while ago.</p>\n<p><strong>I was listening to your call-in to <em>Fox and Friends Weekend</em> yesterday morning, talking about the sketch about you that opened the new season of <em>Saturday Night Live.</em> And you said that the only thing you took issue with was the wig, right?</strong><br>\nOh, terrible. It is my hair, by the way, as you know. As you can probably tell. Yeah, I thought the wig was terrible. I thought everything was fine, (5) but I thought the wig was terrible. It was just so cheap-looking to me. I&#39;d like them to get a much better-looking head of hair on the guy.</p>\n<p><strong>I guess people have been fascinated by your hair for many, many, many years. Do you understand why that is?</strong><br>\nIf you look at the way I combed it up there <em>[he gestures toward his photo gallery]</em>, I mean, it&#39;s similar, right? You know, all these years. I&#39;m a very consistent person. Amazingly consistent person. You know, it is mine. You can follow my record pictorially&#8212;look, see those magazines. It&#39;s all the same haircut, right? You know, it&#39;s sort of funny. But I&#39;ve been combing it this way for a long time, I figure I better not stop.</p>\n<p><strong>Why do you favor such an unusual style?</strong><br>\nI don&#39;t think it&#39;s that unusual. <em>[Ms. Hicks: “No.”]</em> I don&#39;t know. To me, it&#39;s not that unusual. It&#39;s not unusual because it&#39;s the way I&#39;ve been combing it for a long time, since I&#39;m in school.</p>\n<p><strong>It is unusual the way it goes forward and backward.</strong><br>\nNo, it&#39;s not really forward and it&#39;s not really… You know, if you look you know it&#39;s not actually a comb-over.</p>\n<p><strong>I guess people are interested in it now because they think it&#39;s a sign of a sort of vanity.</strong><br>\nVanity? Sure. Maybe it is, maybe it isn&#39;t. I don&#39;t know, I don&#39;t think of it. <em>[Ms. Hicks: “Everybody combs their hair, right?”]</em></p>\n<p><strong>A lot of it is because&#8212;and I don&#39;t believe this to be the case but&#8212;people don&#39;t think there&#39;s really hair there.</strong><br>\nWell, I mean, can you see it? I mean, I actually have a hairline. <em>[He lifts up the front mass so that I can see a distinct, very regular line of hairs stretching upward from the front of his scalp; I gesture that he doesn&#39;t need to do this.]</em> I actually think only the haters&#8212;they know it&#39;s real but they say it&#39;s not. There are haters that say “it&#39;s not his” because they&#39;re haters&#8212;it&#39;s what they do.</p>\n<p><strong>You&#39;ve explained how you used to praise people who are now political enemies, or people you&#39;re competing with, like Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush, (6) by…</strong><br>\nI was a businessman, and I had to get along with everybody. Now I&#39;m a politician, I guess. But when I&#39;m a businessman I get along with everybody. Boy, this is gonna be a bad article. <em>[to Ms. Hicks]</em> You think it&#39;s gonna be fine? I don&#39;t think it&#39;s gonna be fine.

bus tells you everything you need to know because the bus is a piece of shit. You would expect a Donald Trump campaign bus to be MOST LUXURIOUS, MOST DESIRED, NUMBER ONE BUS in the world, with a solid-gold chassis and marble toilets and a rooftop fuck cabana. This is not that bus. “It’s just a bus,” one Trump staffer told me, which is exactly right. It’s an old cross-country bus that still smells like an old cross-country bus, only it’s painted blue, with the name TRUMP in huge letters across both sides, plus the campaign hashtag <em>#Make America Great Again!</em> Trump says he has copyrighted it (“I’m using that a lot, and I think it’s a great statement”) even though you can’t actually put exclamation points or spaces in a hashtag.\n<p>The bus is basically a rolling version of Trump’s Atlantic City: it’s built to look nice for a single day, then it falls into disrepair the moment you’ve stopped paying attention. From a distance, though, the bus looks like a monument. You see the name, and you take in everything that name connotes&#8212;wealth, ego, poor taste&#8212;and the bus has done its job. This is Trump’s bus, and it dominates the landscape the moment it arrives. People from all around take selfies near it. Why? Because TRUMP, that’s why.</p>\n<p>And the bus is working. Perhaps you’ve noticed&#8212;or perhaps you’re trying not to notice&#8212;but Donald Trump is leading all current Republican candidates in the national polls, and his lead is growing. And so it doesn’t really matter whether you see this as an alarming sign of the nation’s growing lunacy, or as a reckoning for a GOP that has been awash for years in hateful rhetoric, or as a byproduct of Trump’s masterful ability to hijack all political coverage by embracing his role as America’s Master Idiot. He’s doing it. At least for a brief moment, he’s winning. And he may extend his lead once the GOP debates begin Thursday night. Trump has managed to plaster his name all over this election as if it were one of his overpriced condos, and he has drawn the crowds as a result.</p>\n<p>And these are real voters out here who are responding to him: real voters who are lining up for his rallies in large numbers (not as large as Trump claims, but still!), real voters who hang on every word of his ridiculous pitch for how he will wheel and deal America back to the top.</p>\n<p>But who the fuck are these people? Are they blind? Are they crazy? Have they been brainwashed by all the giant signs? Or is it possible they see something in Trump that the rest of us don’t? What makes someone want to seriously consider voting for this man? I didn’t know what the answer was, but I wanted to see for myself. I needed to make it make sense. So I went to Iowa&#8212;Iowa: The State You Grew Up Swearing You’d Leave One Day!™&#8212;to meet them. And to see The Donald in the flesh.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Every election dispatch from Iowa is required to include a bit of scenery-setting, to show you just how folksy Iowa is: corn, state fairs, dragonflies, balloon museums, smiling fat babies, etc.</p>\n<p>This is not the Iowa I visited. The Donald Trump Make America Great Again Rally and Family Picnic was held in Oskaloosa, a small town 60 miles east of Des Moines. Oskaloosa is like a lot of small Midwestern towns right now: crumbling houses, shuttered businesses, half-empty strip malls.  You are surrounded by loss here. One of the few thriving businesses I saw in town, apart from a kickass bar called The Cellar Peanut Pub, was a video store. An actual video store. They didn’t even have to rent porn to stay solvent. They had customers, <em>and</em> they were hiring.</p>\n<p>Oskaloosa has been left behind in the Information Age. What has left here is never coming back, no matter what any politician or businessman promises. And people in Osky&#8212;the locals call it “Osky”&#8212;don’t look pleased about this. Contrary to friendly Midwestern stereotypes, they look PISSED. Every man I saw in town looked like your father-in-law the first time you met him at the door. Out on the empty roads, the only vehicles are big, angry pickup trucks with huge side mirrors sticking way out, like they wanna punch your car. People here are aggrieved. People here have had a lot of disappointment, and they are sick of it.</p>\n<p>Like Karen and Diane. Along with a bunch of friends and family, they showed up early this morning to the 696-seat George Daily Community Auditorium (which Oskaloosa’s middle school and high school share) so they could get as close to their billionaire savior as possible. To “see the color of his eyes,” Diane said. I greeted their group as they waited by the door, many of them sitting in nylon golf chairs, nervous about losing their spot in line.</p>\n<p>“I like that Trump won’t back down,” Karen told me. “He says what he means and he means what he’s saying. He ain’t going to say he’s sorry. Sometimes he likes to say things not politically correct, but they all better get used to that. The people who do speak politically correct have been losers.”</p>\n<p>“They constipated America!” Diane said, rocking a House of Blues t-shirt. “What we have had is politicians and lawyers who have constipated America. Let’s get a businessman in there and get things moving! We need our new MiraLAX!”</p>\n<p><em>Do you believe everything Trump says?</em></p>\n<p>“At this point, I’m inclined to say he’s not lying.”</p>\n<p><em>Do you think he exaggerates sometimes?</em></p>\n<p>“Oh yeah. Who doesn’t?”</p>\n<p>“He is for America,” Karen says. “He is for the elderly. He is for the quiet people.”</p>\n<p>Who are “<em>the quiet people</em>”?</p>\n<p>“The people like us, that a lot of times walk around with the attitude that, ‘Oh, it doesn’t matter what I think. I’m just from Osky.’ You know? <em>The quiet people</em>. The people who don’t think they have a voice.”</p>\n<p>Karen used to live in Arizona, where she had a job at a semiconductor plant, adding gold buttons to each chip in on anassembly line. But the plant was relocated to China, and so she lost her job and relocated here. As you could probably surmise, she likes Trump’s tough talk about foreigners stealing our jobs. I had arrived in Iowa just as Trump was doubling down on his comments that Mexico was sending “rapists” across our border; people here loved it, and seemed oddly emotional about the subject of immigration, even though Iowa is nowhere near the border. Apparently, it’s not just the immigrants from <em>Mexico</em> that concern Iowans for Trump. “We need to get the Muslims out of the country,” a man named Bob with a swirling white beard told me, “before they start killing our families!” Everyone around him nodded.</p>\n<p>The line to see Trump grew longer and stretched across the front of Oskaloosa middle school. A local Hy-Vee supermarket put up picnic tables and gave away bottled water, potato salad, pulled pork, and hot dogs thick as flashlights. Elderly people tooted around on Rascal scooters. An enterprising man hocked all-purpose GOP fanboy buttons with slogans like BENGHAZI MATTERS.</p>\n<p>I met an old couple wearing matching Trump t-shirts, which they told me they wore every day. “I haven’t had one bad comment on it,” said the wife. I met a man named Wayne who voted for Obama twice but was now firmly in Trump’s corner. I met ANOTHER man named Wayne who walked me carefully through his five-point rationale for why Trump was the best candidate. (Voters often show up at these rallies with little stump speeches of their own.) I met a woman named Jill who showed up with several hand-drawn signs. (My favorite was “Beltway Talks; Trump Works.”) Jill was <em>fired the fuck up</em> for some Trump in her life. I don’t know how it’s possible to be so fired up with the election so far away, but Jill was <em>blazing</em>. She wanted to make sure the whole world knew that Trump and his voters were for real.</p>\n<p>“I was terribly insulted when [John McCain] called us crazies,” Jill told me.</p>\n<p><em>What is it that you like so much about Trump?</em></p>\n<p>“He’s a capitalist,” Jill explained. “That inspires me.”</p>\n<p>I also ran into a very rare minority in the crowd&#8212;a Pakistani woman who emigrated here from Pakistan 40 years ago and didn’t like the idea of anyone skirting the naturalization process.</p>\n<p>“I came in the right way,” she told me. “When you try to do things the right way, it doesn’t work. And all these illegals sneaking in, and being able to stay&#8212;how do they get to do that?”</p>\n<p><em>And you think Trump will make things fairer</em>.</p>\n<p>“Well, as long as he does a better job than what’s being done. You know?”</p>\n<p>A nervous drug counselor named Tracy was also in line to see Trump. Unlike some of the others, she had some concerns about him. Well, one: “He’s an atheist,” she said.</p>\n<p>A man nearby overheard us talking and told us he shared her worry. “We have to elect godly men.”</p>\n<p>But Jill&#8212;the sign lady&#8212;cut into the conversation and came to the rescue: “He’s not an atheist. I wanted to correct that. He explained the church he’s gone to his whole life. He didn’t articulate it as well as he should have. But you know what? That articulation&#8212;I’m not concerned with that.”</p>\n<p>That seemed to cool Tracy’s hangups about Trump being a godless heathen.</p>\n<p>And I spotted a woman pushing around a stroller with a photograph of a live abortion taped to it, along with a big sign that read “DEAR PLANNED PARENTHOOD, I AM NOT FOR SALE.” For some reason, the woman ditched the stroller in the middle of the path leading to the auditorium, and a squat veteran named Randy went to alert the police. “That’s a good way to get a bomb brought in,” he said. While we all stared at the stroller, looking for any suspicious bulges (it turned out to be clean), Randy explained to me why he had a big ol’ Trump-on.</p>\n<p>“I like what he has to say. He won’t take no shit from nobody.”</p>\n<p><em>What’s your favorite thing he’s said?</em></p>\n<p>“You’re fired!”</p>\n<p><em>Who would you like him to fire, besides Obama?</em></p>\n<p>“Let’s see: John Kerry, our last governor, the attorney general, every Muslim that they put in…”</p>\n<p>Randy seemed untroubled by Trump’s lack of polish, or knowledge, or basic human grace. Far from it&#8212;these were virtues. “You don’t have to be a brain to run a business,” Randy said. “Just an ass. Sometimes you can be nice and polite, but there’s sometimes you’ve just got to be a horse’s ass with somebody to get them to do what they’re supposed to be doing.”</p>\n<p>So far, I’d heard Trump compared&#8212;favorably&#8212;to a horse’s ass and to a laxative, and I began to imagine a Trump campaign poster that was just a big horse’s butthole spewing hot diarrhea.</p>\n<p><em>So you believe Trump has the fearlessness to run this country?</em></p>\n<p>“I know he does,” said Randy. “Have you ever watched <em>The Apprentice?</em>”</p>\n<p>I talked to more voters and a pattern emerged in the answers. Trump was “honest,” “not PC,” “authentic,” “shooting from the hip,” and “called a spade a spade.” And of course, he wasn’t from Washington. He was gonna get in there and shake things up.</p>\n<p>We’ve heard all of this before, from many, many other candidates. Every presidential election has at least one magical, imaginary OUTSIDER&#8212;that teenage wet dream of a president who rides into Washington, tells those bureaucrats what shitheads they are, and bulldozes Congress into doing cool shit simply with the power of his huge cock. I have fallen for this kind of candidate. YOU have fallen for this kind of candidate. Everybody wants this mythical Bulworth to exist, but at this level of politics, there are no outsiders, and the game changes its rules for no one.</p>\n<p>And yet, people buy in. Maybe this time, they think, the guy who says he’s different really is different.</p>\n<p>And Trump, to his credit, is definitely different.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Noon was approaching and the doors to the auditorium opened. Trump supporters poured into seats in front of the stage and onto a set of risers behind the podium. The hated media&#8212;that would include me&#8212;sat toward the back.</p>\n<p>After a couple of introductory speeches from a local politician and a member of Seal Team Seven (not Six, but Seven&#8212;they’re one better!), we were greeted by former <em>Apprentice</em> runner-up Tana Goertz, who also happens to be Trump 2016’s Iowa co-chair and a “well-known Bedazzler spokeswoman.”</p>\n<p>“We all know how much Donald Trump is worth!” Goertz cried out, inaccurately. “How much?” The response from the crowd was messy and overlapping&#8212;many wild guesses called out at once.</p>\n<p>“I’ve met a lot of smart people,” Goertz continued, undaunted, “but I have never met a man that thinks about working when other people are talking about working.”</p>\n<p><em>Wait, what?</em></p>\n<p>“At the heart of it all, he’s a builder. Who better than Donald Trump to rebuild this country?”</p>\n<p>Okay, that’s a metaphor I can get behind.</p>\n<p>“You have never ever in your life experienced what you’re about to experience today. I’m just going to say: Sit back, put on your seatbelt. It’s going to be a fun ride. You will enjoy the experience and the ride, which is Donald Trump.”</p>\n<p>Finally&#8212;after a quick Pledge of Allegiance&#8212;the man himself emerged through a side door, carried aloft by the strains of Joe Esposito’s “You’re The Best.”</p>\n<p>I saw the hair first. It arrived in two parts: first the Turtle Wax-ed strands that run along both sides of his scalp, then the champagne glitter yarn kit perched top. I’d never seen Trump before, and the hair was all that I’d hoped for, and more. And after announcing his intention to molest all of Iowa’s chief export (“I want to grab that corn like you’ve never seen&#8212;so beautiful”) the ride started up.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>I’m gonna say a few nice things about Donald Trump now. If that terrifies you, then by all means, skim through this section and carry on with your existence.</p>\n<p>But I must tell you that, in person, Donald Trump is a very entertaining public speaker. And is this really such a surprise? Ever since* The Art of the Deal*, Trump has spent decades giving speeches all over the country, acting as our Get-Rich-Quick godfather. When he gets in front of a microphone, he requires no notes. No teleprompter. He is confident. He is casual. He is charming. Everyone is a “great guy” or an “amazing negotiator.”</p>\n<p>He can even be funny. When I texted a friend from the event that Trump was hilarious in person, he texted back, “NO. No no no.” Sorry, it’s true. It’s still not clear whether he’s in on the joke&#8212;there’s always been a bit of mystery to how aware Donald Trump is that Donald Trump is full of shit. But when you see him in person, and you hear him claim that the term “Supreme Leader” would be more fitting for him than for the head of Iran, there is the tiniest hint that he knows what a ludicrous thing this is to say. Even his exaggerations are hilarious. He said this was the biggest crowd in state history, even though we were in a public-school auditorium. He said he was worth more than $10 billion, a figure that is impossible for him to prove but also impossible for us to disprove. He said he made $213 million from <em>The Apprentice</em>, a figure which NBC steadfastly refutes.</p>\n<p>At one point, Trump boasted about how much veterans adore him. To prove it, he trotted out a gorgeous brunette who was carrying a perfect stack of white paper topped with a bow. I swear it looked like an unwrapped package of blank Hammermill printer paper. “In one day,” Trump blared, “many hundreds of letters from Vietnam vets, thanking me. This is from veterans. Each page, a different letter. It’s amazing.”</p>\n<p>Everyone ate it up. They laughed and cheered and hollered out in approval all through his speech.  It was more like a late-night monologue, and true to his reputation, Trump is not careful with his words. You can see why people think he’s more “honest” than one of the other randos in the GOP field&#8212;he’s gifted at not sounding like a politician even as he deploys standard tricks from the “I’m not a politician” handbook. He is definitely more fun to watch than Bobby Jindal. I wish there were more Trump-like candidates out there who are not Donald Trump, if that makes any sense.</p>\n<p>He also made a good point or two in between all the noise. At one point he bellowed: “I read Jeb Bush raised over a hundred million dollars. Now if you think that those people giving him all those money aren’t getting a lot, you’re wrong. All of these people are controlled by the people who gave them their money.” He’s right! It’s true! Holy shit, Donald Trump said a true thing. I heard it with my own two ears.</p>\n<p>If Donald Trump has one undeniable virtue as a politician, it’s that he does not try to fake being one of us. He’s not going to the fucking Bowl-o-Rama on a Saturday night in a plaid shirt to prove he’s a man of the people. The whole thrust of The Donald’s campaign is that he is special. He is extraordinary. In Osky, he compared his business acumen to Jack Nicklaus’ golfing ability and Babe Ruth’s hitting ability. (“It’s called talent. <em>Talent</em>.”) He is a WINNER, and he is here to help this nation of sad losers learn how to win again.</p>\n<p>“We don’t win anymore in this country,” he told the crowd. “When was the last time we won? When did we beat China in a deal? We don’t win.”</p>\n<p>Well, Trump is here to fix all that losing. And here is where my brief jag of mildly effusive praise for Donald Trump must come to an end, because the grim undercurrent of his rise is SHAME.  After all, if you believe we must make America great again, then you must also believe that America, at the present moment, sucks. And pretty much everyone at the Trump picnic believed that America sucks. When I asked a group of Trump supporters outside if they were proud of America, they all laughed with derision. <em>Of course</em> they weren’t proud of America. Of course this nation is a shithole. One voter named Corey told me he hoped Trump would help America “get back to the way it was,” a refrain I heard from a lot of people, as if the country was a rock band that had changed its sound. Backing Trump means acknowledging that you live in a world of failure, and that your last best hope is the Music Man moseying into town.</p>\n<p>Now, here is how Donald Trump says he will Make America Great Again™. In Trump’s worldview, politics is little more than series of deals to be made. Every complex global problem, or intractable adversary, can be tamed with sufficiently hard-ass steakhouse dealmaking. He explained it all in Osky:</p>\n<p>“I know the greatest negotiators in the world,” he said. “Now some of these people are horrible human beings. You wouldn’t have them to dinner. They’re vicious. They’re crude. They’re unhappy. They treat everybody badly. Who cares? I want them negotiating against China. Think of Carl Icahn, a friend of mine. He’d be great. I’d say, ‘Carl, take China’.”</p>\n<p>Now, people applauded this, which alarmed me because (A) Who has friends like this? And (B) Sending a vicious, crude, unhappy person who treats everyone badly to go yell FUCK YOU at the Chinese strikes me as unwise.</p>\n<p>But Trump is so certain, so supremely confident, that everyone at his rallies go for the idea anyway. It comes off as an act of counterintuitive genius. What’s not to like about the idea that you can fix everything by just marching into Washington and yelling at all the dummies to stop being dummies? I wish politics were that simple. I really do. Politics <em>should</em> be that simple. Trump’s gift is that he really can make it sound that easy, even when it’s all a huge lie. His swagger is <em>your</em> swagger. He can reduce entire countries down to a cardboard persona. He’ll get tough with Mexico. He’ll have Carl take China. The way Trump explains it, you’d think China had only one person in it.</p>\n<p>Trump is so certain of his horseshit that, on that stage in Osky, he laid out a remarkable future scenario of him in the Oval Office that was essentially one enormous lie that hasn’t had the chance to become a lie yet. Here now is what President Trump would do if Ford tried to build a manufacturing plant down in Mexico:</p>\n<p>“It’s so easy. <em>It’s too easy</em>. I do it with a phone call. I call the head of Ford, and I say, ‘Every single car and truck that comes into the US, we’re going to tax you 35 percent’.”</p>\n<p>Massive applause! Trump wasn’t done.</p>\n<p>“So this isn’t 99.9 percent&#8212;this is <em>one hundred percent</em> what’s going to happen: He’ll call me back, probably that afternoon, but he may play it tough and call me back the next day. The next day I’ll get a call from Ben Ford”&#8212;NOTE: there is no Ben Ford; I assume he meant Bill&#8212;“and he’ll say, ‘Mr. President, we decided not to build that plant. We’ll build it in the United States.’”</p>\n<p>And everyone in the joint bought it! They damn near broke their hands clapping for this idea! I almost bought it myself! At least, I did for half a second before I thought, <em>Wait, don’t you need Congress to approve shit like that? And wouldn’t forcing the plant to be built here increase the cost of Fords? And then wouldn’t people stop buying Fords? And then wouldn’t Ford go belly up, costing us even MORE jobs than if we had just left the goddamn plant in Mexico? And what about the many, many Fords that are already produced in Mexico?</em></p>\n<p>But a Trump rally isn’t about thinking more than half a second ahead. There is a first BOLD step, and then you are left to assume that everything else will fall neatly into place. In Trump’s white-trash, Louis XIV universe, all you see is the pretty gold paint before it starts chipping off the walls.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Money, ironically, is what will likely wind up being Trump’s political downfall. Once the primary field has been winnowed down to a few schlubs, the GOP establishment will dump its funds into a single candidate with the goal of overtaking Trump, whom they all despise. (Yet one more reason why voters here love him, by the way.) And as rich Trump may claim to be, there are limits to how much of his personal fortune he’ll spend on this effort.</p>\n<p>Once the GOP muscles him out, Trump may very well run a third-party campaign that divides conservative voters and all but hands the 2016 election to a waiting Hillary Clinton. In Osky, this was every thinking Trump voter’s nightmare scenario. “As long as he doesn’t split parties, I’m there,” one attendee told me. “If he does that, it’s too important of an election.” But it could happen. And if it does, Trump may go from the darling of far-right conservatives voters to their most-hated nemesis.</p>\n<p>At the end of Trump’s speech, “We’re Not Gonna Take It” by Twisted Sister boomed through the speakers and played him off the stage.  The crowd grave him a standing O on his way out. The ride was over. The reviews outside were glowing: “Awesome.” “I loved his demeanor.” “Solutions.” “It’s nice to hear somebody talk who’s not a politician.” They were all sold. They were all going to home to preach the gospel of their King Midas.</p>\n<p>As I watched everyone file out, I thought of a moment during Tana Goertz’s opening-act speech earlier in the day, when she pleaded with everyone to eat more of the food outside. “Mr. Trump can’t take all this food home on the plane,” she told us. “There’s not enough room.” And so as all of Trump’s energized constituents filed out of the joint, I pictured him getting onto his plane, cigar in the corner of his mouth, jetting back to the Land of Winners. And I pictured everyone else stuck back here in Osky, with nothing but the scraps he left behind for all the quiet people.</p>","channel":"News & Culture","subChannel":"Politics","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"identifiable":true,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"revisionAuthor":"Freddie Campion","issueDate":"","hed":"What Kind of Person Would Vote For Donald Trump?

He couldn’t stop trying to win everyone over, whether it was a <em>60 Minutes</em> correspondent, 500 powerful donors in a crowded banquet hall, or a fetching woman on a rope line.\n<p>If Clinton acted like someone who ran Capitol Records, Obama&#8212;both the person <em>and</em> the president&#8212;carries himself like Roger Federer, a merciless competitor who keeps coming and coming, only there’s a serenity about him that\ndisarms just about everyone. At one point during the hour I spent interviewing him at the White House this fall, he casually compared himself to Aaron Rodgers, and he wasn’t bragging. Obama identified with Rodgers’s ability to keep his focus downfield despite all the chaos happening in front of him. That’s Obama’s enduring quality,\nand (to borrow another sports term) this has been his “career year.”</p>\n<p>Obama lives in America’s most famous museum and uses it to his advantage. You’re sitting there in some ancient tearoom waiting for him to show up, surrounded by portraits of former first ladies and framed maps from battles\nthat America won over the centuries. Everyone is friendly but suspicious. Everyone talks in hushed tones. You feel like you’re intruding at all times. You’re just…waiting. Suddenly, ten anonymous security guards pop out of hallways\nand doorways that you didn’t know were there. The energy shifts. And then, there’s Obama&#8212;big smile, big handshake, some ball-busting comments to put everyone at ease. Within seconds of greeting me, he was poking fun at my shoes and teasing me for not writing anymore.</p>\n<p>“It’s really aggravating not having you on Grantland,” he said, almost like I betrayed him. “I go to the site and there’s no Simmons. Come on, man, it’s not the same.”</p>\n<p>It’s an alpha-male trick&#8212;put someone off-balance, flatter them and bust their chops at the same time. A few minutes later, he was grabbing control of the interview with measured responses, knowing that he didn’t have to perform\nwithout cameras or podcast equipment. And so he took his time. And it worked. I mean, how do you interrupt the most powerful man on earth? It felt like the way Federer repeatedly jumped Novak Djokovic’s second serve in the 2015 U.S. Open Final&#8212;a savvy trick to disrupt someone’s flow, a seemingly harmless way to gain an edge. It’s what the great competitors do.</p>\n<p>In January, Obama will begin his eighth and final year on the job. It’s an <em>era</em> now. What has he learned about leadership? What was his biggest regret? Why did it seem like, in 2015, he finally started letting it fly, threw on his Beefsquatch costume and let everyone know “THIS IS ME NOW!” Gay marriage, health care, Charleston, the Iran deal… If you voted against him, 2015 was the year when his inner confidence bothered you more than ever. And if you voted for him, 2015 was definitely the year when you said, “<em>That</em> is the guy I voted for.” But what if Barack Obama has been that guy all along?</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>BILL SIMMONS: If you could go back to 2008 and tell yourself one thing, what would it be?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>BARACK OBAMA:</strong> “You’re going to be busy.” Coming in, we were going through an unprecedented economic upheaval, combined with an upheaval in the Middle East that we hadn’t seen in our lifetimes. There was going\nto be a huge amount of disruption. I would probably tell myself to communicate more effectively early on than I did. We ran a great campaign. It wasn’t as great as it seems in retrospect&#8212;there’s always rose-colored glasses but there’s no doubt that we captured the country’s imagination. And somehow in those first two years, I think a certain arrogance crept in, in the sense of thinking as long as we get the policy ready, we didn’t have to sell it.</p>\n<p>One thing I learned through some tough election cycles: You can’t separate good policy from the need to bring the American people along and make sure that they know why you’re doing what you’re doing. And that’s particularly\ntrue now in this new communications era. I think that we were ahead of the curve in 2008 in social media and the Internet and digital communications. When we came into office, instead of taking some of those lessons, we\nsuddenly adapted ourselves to the White House press room and structures that had been built back in the 1940s and ’50s. As a consequence of those missteps early, we got the policies right, and that’s why the economy now has grown for five and a half straight years, six years, and why unemployment rates have gone from 10 percent to 5.1 percent. But there was a lot of political pain along the way that might not have been necessary.</p>\n<p><strong>Was there a point in those first three years where you started to feel overwhelmed by the job? Where you\nwere just like, “My God, I just had no idea this was going to be this hard!”</strong><br>\nI had a pretty good handle. One thing I learned during the campaign was that I’ve got a good temperament. I don’t get too high and I don’t get too low. I’m able to stay focused even when there’s a lot of stuff going on around me.</p>\n<p><strong>So you’re like Gregg Popovich. Although he does get mad at sideline reporters.</strong><br>\n<em>[laughs]</em> He does. So do I. <em>[laughs]</em> Yeah. Or maybe [Aaron] Rodgers in the pocket, in the sense of you can’t be distracted by what’s around you, you’ve got to be looking downfield. And I think that’s a quality that I have&#8212;not getting flustered in what’s around me. So there was never a point, even early on&#8212;even in the first six months, where we weren’t sure whether we were going to dip into another Great Depression, we weren’t sure whether the steps we were taking on rescuing the auto industry or stabilizing the financial system were going to work&#8212;there weren’t moments where I thought, “Sheesh, feels like we’re in over our head.”</p>\n<p>But what I didn’t fully appreciate, and nobody can appreciate until they’re in the position, is how decentralized power is in this system. When you’re in the seat and you’re seeing the housing market collapse and you are seeing unemployment skyrocketing and you have a sense of what the right thing to do is, then you realize, “Okay, not only do I have to persuade my own party, not only do I have to prevent the other party from blocking what the right thing to do is, but now I can anticipate this lawsuit, this lobbying taking place, and this federal agency that technically is independent, so I can’t tell them what to do. I’ve got the Federal Reserve, and I’m hoping that they do the right thing&#8212;and by the way, since the economy now is global, I’ve got to make sure that the Europeans, the Asians, the Chinese, everybody is on board.” A lot of the work is not just identifying the right policy but now constantly building these ever shifting coalitions to be able to actually implement and execute and get it done.</p>\n<p><strong>You’re out to dinner with your wife and the phone rings. How many of the people in your life are you like, “Uh-oh, I’ve got to take this”?</strong><br>\nMalia and Sasha. <em>[laughs]</em> And maybe my mother-in-law. My national security adviser, Susan Rice, and Denis McDonough, my chief of staff. Those are the only people whose call I would take during a date night with Michelle. But the entire White House is full of people who have enormous responsibilities. You can’t do this by yourself. The principle of team building in the White House is really no different than the principle of team building anywhere, on a sports team or a well-run business. Do they put team ahead of themselves? Do you make sure all the pieces fit together? Because just having the best athletes, if they’re knocking heads and nobody’s doing rebounding and everybody wants the ball, it isn’t always going to work.</p>\n<p><strong>Is it fair to say that in 2015, you’ve been like the second-semester high school senior who got into Yale and now is like, “I’m going out tonight&#8212;I don’t care if I have a test tomorrow”? All of us were kind of waiting for that guy to show up after he got re-elected. What took two years to get there?</strong><br>\nThere’s no doubt that the longer I’m in this job, the more confident I am about the decisions I’m making and more knowledgeable about the responses I can expect. And as a consequence, you end up being looser. There’s not much I have not seen at this point, and I know what to expect, and I can anticipate more than I did before.</p>\n<p>I [also] have a case to make now that was harder to make earlier in my presidency. We had confidence, for example, that the economic decisions that we made to stabilize the financial system and pass Wall Street reform and raise\ntaxes on the wealthiest and pass health care&#8212;that would have a payoff. But because we had been in such a deep hole, we had to be careful about crowing success when people weren’t feeling it. And it wasn’t really until around 2014 where the attitude of the American people was, “The economy’s improving, I’m feeling better.”</p>\n<p><strong>So you feed off that.</strong><br>\nYou can make your case without caveats, which, I think, hampered my ability to communicate confidence and optimism to people. You didn’t want people to feel as if you were getting ahead of yourself. It’s a combination of me feeling looser because I’ve just been in this job a long time and have gone through some tough stretches. Not only do you not look like you have any fear, but you actually <em>don’t</em> have any fear. And I don’t at this point. The bets we made early on have paid off. Some of it does have to do with luck.</p>\n<p>Think about 2013, right after I’d been re-elected: Our goal was to lead with a big push on immigration reform. And then, before the second inauguration has even happened, [the school shooting at] Sandy Hook happens. Which remains, by the way, the worst few days of my presidency. I went up and visited with those families and&#8212;you know, Bill, you’ve still got small kids. These are 6-year-olds, right? And you have 20 of them who’ve been massacred. Right away, our focus had to shift to “Is there a way for us to capture this moment to see if we can get over this incredible hump to try to put in place some common-sense gun-safety rules?” And we knew it was a stretch, just because of the politics of Congress and the NRA. But we had to try.</p>\n<p>And throughout 2013 and 2014, you had a series of events like that&#8212;the Snowden disclosures, Ebola, Ferguson, ISIL, and unaccompanied children coming across the borders&#8212;all sort of stacked up in a row. None of them individually unsolvable, but given the 24/7 news cycle, they just sort of pile up on each other. Even though, in the midst of this, the economy is improving and we are making real progress on education and health care and energy and so forth, political momentum turns sharply against you. And so we’ve had more than our share of stormy seas, but we’ve navigated the ship well.</p>\n<p><strong>When Ferguson happened last year, I was waiting for Obama the Person to come in. But you had to be President Obama. How you handled Charleston this year and Selma&#8212;that was Obama the Person. So what happened with Ferguson? Do you wish you had handled that differently?</strong><br>\nYou know, the challenge of Ferguson and all issues related to police shootings, race, and the criminal-justice system is that in order to actually get something done, you have to build consensus. Expressing simple outrage without\nfollow-up is often counterproductive. In the case of Ferguson, I’m the attorney general’s boss. If I chime in with a strong opinion about what’s happened, not only do I stand to potentially damage subsequent law-enforcement cases, but immediately you get blowback and backlash that may make people less open to listening. What was different in Charleston was the clarity of what happened&#8212;that allowed, I think, everybody to be open to it.</p>\n<p><strong>Did it take time during the presidency to realize what kind of moments those were?</strong><br>\nYes, sometimes it’s feel. Sometimes the circumstances won’t give you a clean statement. The fact that race has always been the fault line of our society and has always distorted our politics&#8212;that is not subject to argument. Part of what you’re looking for is a way not to just vent but to actually move the people. I practiced law for a while&#8212;a lot of times, hard cases can make bad law. If you have an issue that you want to put forward, you’re looking for the right plaintiff and the right court to appear before. I do think as you go on as president, you get a better feel for this, but you’re not always going to be perfect. When the Trayvon Martin case happened, I had an honest response as a father that I think resonated with a lot of people. When Ferguson happened, there was a gap between how quickly we could pull together a police task force, recommendations. And so in that lag, it feels as if I haven’t spoken to the moment as effectively. I suspect that if I were to do it over again, there might be something I could say that would’ve crystallized it more effectively. But Ferguson&#8212;the case itself was tougher because people didn’t know what was going on exactly. In some ways the [Eric] Garner case in New York was clearer because you had on videotape exactly what had happened, and some of the subsequent cases have been more obvious.</p>\n<p>One thing you learn as president is you’re not always going to perform flawlessly and you have to be able to put that out of your mind and then look at the next problem coming down the pipe. If I’m working out in the gym, sometimes I’ll go to NBA Classics and watch some of these old classic games&#8212;</p>\n<p><strong>The lack of HD really hurts&#8212;you can barely see anybody.</strong><br>\nIt’s true&#8212;and the graphics at the bottom are terrible. But a thing that you’re reminded of, watching those old Bulls games, is Jordan had some stinker games in the playoffs. But he would get that out of his mind, and then the next moment comes and he’s right there. He could have a terrible game for the first three quarters and then suddenly go crazy the fourth. Or he might miss a free throw, and then the next play is he’s stealing the ball and hitting the game-winning shot. Part of what I try to do&#8212;not at the level that Jordan did on the basketball court, but part of what you aspire to as president or any of these positions of leadership&#8212;is to try to figure out how to be in the moment, make the best decision you can, know that you’re going to get a bunch of them right, but a bunch of times you’re also not going to get it exactly the way you want it.</p>\n<p><strong>You win the election in 2008, and Twitter is just becoming a thing. Over the course of your presidency, that’s the biggest thing that’s changed. What’s the biggest challenge with all that stuff?</strong><br>\nSpeed. You are on 24/7&#8212;you have to respond immediately. The job of our office, to keep up and to respond quickly to anything that’s happening but not be consumed by it, is completely different. We’ve been building a digital team inside the White House.</p>\n<p><strong>When did that start?</strong><br>\nToo late. That’s an example of something that I would’ve started earlier. That was a lesson that coming out of the first term, I should’ve understood. That’s why we built this team. It’s so interesting watching my daughters. Both are complete ninjas on the phone, right? And they can do things that I don’t even understand&#8212;they’re doing it in two seconds. But I even see a difference between Malia, who’s 17, and Sasha, who’s 14. There’s almost a mini-generational gap in terms of Sasha being so connected seamlessly to this smartphone in a way that Malia, who was already a little bit older when it really started to take, is not.</p>\n<p><strong>The ability to multitask with 19 different friends at the same time…</strong><br>\nYeah. And just the degree to which her social life is so connected to that. So it’s not just having to change how we do business inside the White House to react to stories, but also, how do we tell a story about issues to constituencies that are completely splintered, who don’t watch television in the same way, who don’t watch the news in the same way? In some ways we’re just laying the foundation for what I assume will be the standard practice of future presidents.</p>\n<p><strong>Gun control: You’ve tried to legislate it as much as you possibly could and hit a wall basically in every direction. But the one thing Hillary Clinton has brought up is executive action.</strong><br>\nWell, keep in mind that after Sandy Hook, we put forward 23 executive actions. So we haven’t been asleep at the switch in terms of executive actions that we’ve tried. There are maybe a few more that had to be scrubbed by lawyers because, essentially, with every executive action, we can count on it being challenged by somebody in Congress or, in this case, the NRA. We want to make any executive action we take as defensible as possible legally. In the absence of a movement politically in which people say, “Enough is enough,” we’re going to continue to see, unfortunately, these tragedies take place. The main thing that I’ve been trying to communicate over the last several of these horrific episodes is that, contrary to popular belief, Americans are not more violent than people in other developed countries. But they have more deadly weapons to act out their rage, and that’s the only main variable that you see between the U.S. and these other countries.</p>\n<p><strong>It does feel like it’s going to become the dominant issue of year eight.</strong><br>\nI hope so. We have this weird habit in this culture of mourning and, you know, 48, 72 hours of wall-to-wall coverage, and then…suddenly we move on. And I will do everything I can to make sure that there’s a sustained attention paid to this thing.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s the most entertaining conspiracy theory you ever read about yourself?</strong><br>\nThat military exercises we were doing in Texas were designed to begin martial law so that I could usurp the Constitution and stay in power longer. Anybody who thinks I could get away with telling Michelle I’m going to be president any longer than eight years does not know my wife.</p>\n<p><strong>Have you ever said, “Give me the JFK-assassination files, I want to read them. Give me all the secret stuff”?</strong><br>\nI gotta tell you, it’s a little disappointing. People always ask me about Roswell and the aliens and UFOs, and it turns out the stuff going on that’s top secret isn’t nearly as exciting as you expect. In this day and age, it’s not as top secret as you’d think.</p>\n<p><strong>Would you ever want to be a Supreme Court justice?</strong><br>\n<em>[pauses]</em></p>\n<p><strong>You paused!</strong><br>\nNo&#8212;well, the reason I paused for a second was just to make sure that I let people know that I think good judges are really important, and Supreme Court justices, obviously, are hugely important. I don’t have the temperament to sit in relative solitude and just opine and write from the bench. I want to be in the action a little bit more.</p>\n<p><strong>Is it true you have a virtual driving range in the White House?</strong><br>\nTrue.</p>\n<p><strong>It’s in the bowels of the White House?</strong><br>\nYeah, I mean, this is not like some super-fancy thing. But I can hit these Wiffle balls.</p>\n<p><strong>So you go down there and hit, like as a stress reliever?</strong><br>\nYeah. Just whack ’em. Whack ’em around a little bit.</p>\n<p><strong>Has anyone come to the White House and picked up your older daughter for a date?</strong><br>\nNo, but I’ve seen some folks glancing at her in ways that made me not happy.</p>\n<p><strong>Tell the Secret Service, “Just take out that guy over there”?</strong><br>\n“Just keep an eye on him.”</p>\n<p><strong>Does it scare you that your wife could have a billion-dollar daytime talk show and you could be Stedman 2.0?</strong><br>\n<em>[laughs]</em> Uh…</p>\n<p><strong>Because that’s in play. She could do that if she wanted.</strong><br>\nAnd if that’s what she wants to do, I’m okay with her making a whole lot of money. There’s nothing wrong with that.</p>\n<p><strong>Would you ever want to be part of the ownership for an NBA team?</strong><br>\nAbsolutely.</p>\n<p><strong>Would it have to be the Bulls, or would it have to be somebody else?</strong><br>\nWell, you know, I know [Jerry] Reinsdorf pretty good&#8212;he’s not giving that thing up anytime soon. But I have fantasized about being able to put together a team and how much fun that would be. I think it’d be terrific.</p>\n<p><strong>How many times have you said to your kids, “Stop Googling me”?</strong><br>\nI don’t have to tell them that. They have no interest in me. I mean, they’re hopefully interested in me as a father.</p>\n<p><strong>Not as a public figure. What’s your guiltiest-pleasure TV show? Don’t say <em>Game of Thrones</em>, because that’s a good show.</strong><br>\nProbably the guiltiest pleasure&#8212;and this is kind of lame&#8212;is <em>Big Break</em>. You know, on the Golf Channel? Which is kind of a silly show. <em>[laughs]</em> But I find it really relaxing.</p>\n<p><strong>So you watch it on the treadmill or something?</strong><br>\nYeah, when I’m working out sometimes late at night. I never see all the episodes, but if they’ve got some chipping contest or something… <em>[laughs]</em> It’s pretty lame. I do love <em>Game of Thrones</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Which character do you identify with?</strong><br>\nMy favorite character is probably…the dwarf, what’s his name?</p>\n<p><strong>Oh, yeah. Peter Dinklage’s character.</strong><br>\nThe problem with <em>Game of Thrones,</em> though, is that I don’t remember the names of any of the characters.</p>\n<p><strong>I don’t, either.</strong><br>\nI remember the characters, so when I watch it, I know exactly what’s going on. But if you read a review of the show afterwards and they’re mentioning such and such, the only one I remember is Jon Snow, because I can pronounce Jon Snow.</p>\n<p><strong>Which <em>Game of Thrones</em> character is Donald Trump?</strong><br>\nUh…I don’t think…I don’t think any of them rise to that level.</p>\n<p><strong>If you were campaigning against Trump, would you even bother? Would it be like LaBradford Smith talking trash to Jordan or something?</strong><br>\nI would’ve enjoyed campaigning against Trump. That would’ve been fun.</p>\n<p><strong>Which leadership style suits your vision of where America should go forward? Biden or Hillary?</strong><br>\n<em>[laughs]</em> Come on, Bill.</p>\n<p><strong>I had to ask you one thing you can’t answer! Here’s one you have to answer: Who’s more untradable, Derrick Rose or Jay Cutler?</strong><br>\n<em>[pause]</em> Oh, I think Rose still has more upside. Remember, Rose is still awfully young.</p>\n<p><strong>So you haven’t given up on Rose?</strong><br>\nI’ve not given up on him. Sadly, I think it’s hard to imagine, after that many injuries, him getting back to his MVP-season performance. But he can still be a top-ten point guard.</p>\n<p><strong>Baseball, football, basketball, all the commissioner jobs open up next year. Which one would you want?</strong><br>\nWell, I’m best suited for basketball. But I cannot believe that the commissioner of football gets paid\n$44 million a year.</p>\n<p><strong>When you said, “I cannot believe…,” I didn’t know where you were going with that. Have you thought about calling <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/roger-goodell-season-from-hell\">Roger Goodell</a> and being like, “What are you <em>doing?</em> Can I help you?” [<em>Obama laughs</em>.] “Can I give you some advice? Want to have dinner?”</strong><br>\nThey’re making a profit, and I think that’s what the owners are most concerned with.</p>\n<p><strong>So you think the owners like having him there?</strong><br>\nYou’re not going to drag me into your fights, man. Come on&#8212;I’ve got enough fights of my own. <em>[laughs]</em> This is between you and Roger.</p>\n<p><strong>Number of cigarettes you’ve smoked in the White House since you got here?</strong><br>\nZero in the last five years. I made a promise that once health care passed, I would never have a cigarette again. And I have not.</p>\n<p><strong>What perk of being president are you going to miss the most?</strong><br>\nSo the clear answer would be Air Force One: an amazing plane with an amazing crew, they clear out airspace so you don’t have to wait. And you land anytime, you leave anytime. But it may be Marine One, because even post presidency, I may be able to round up a private plane sometime, but it’s tough not to have your helicopter waiting for you. <em>[laughs]</em></p>\n<p><strong>The last time I talked to you, you had one teenage daughter.</strong><br>\nNow I have two.</p>\n<p><strong>I’m two years away. Is it better, worse, or the same than what you expected when everybody told you, “Oh, just wait&#8212;just wait till they’re teenagers”?</strong><br>\nMy daughters are amazing girls. They’re smart, they’re funny. They take after their mom, and Michelle’s done a great job with them. You get these teenage moments&#8212;they love you, but what I think really affects you most is they just don’t have time for you. It’s not an active disdain for you. It’s just their calendars start filling up and they’ve got all\nthese friends who are much more interesting.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h2>The 14 Best Photos from the White House Flickr Account</h2>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Yeah, you’re not the coolest person in their lives anymore.</strong><br>\nAnd you just have to let go, you have to acknowledge that if you say to them, “Hey, you want to go watch this movie?” or “Hey, you want to go take a swim at the pool?” “No, sorry, Daddy. I love you, though. See you tomorrow, ’cause I’m spending the night at somebody’s house.” The golden age is between, say, 6, 7, and 12, and they’re your buddies and they just want to hang out. And after that, they will love you, but they don’t have that much time for you. And my understanding is, based on friends of mine who have older kids, is that with a little bit of luck, as long as you’re not so completely annoying during these teenage years, they’ll come back to you around 23, 24, and actually want to hang out with you. But that stretch is painful. The compensation you get for the fact that they don’t have time for you is: Nothing beats watching your children become smarter and cooler than you are. And you suddenly will hear them say something or make a joke or have an insight and you go,\n“Wow. I didn’t think of that.”</p>\n<p><strong>Are they ready for you to be the ex-president?</strong><br>\nNot as much as Michelle, but certainly ready.</p>\n<p><strong>Oh, Michelle’s the leader of the power rankings?</strong><br>\nOh, absolutely. There are clear rankings. Michelle. Malia and Sasha, they’re constantly wrestling for second place. I rank ahead of the dogs.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Bill Simmons</strong> <em>is the founder of Grantland, the co-creator of ESPN’s</em> 30 for 30 <em>sports documentary series, and the best-selling

He couldn’t always harness it. He couldn’t stop trying to win everyone over, whether it was a <em>60 Minutes</em> correspondent, 500 powerful donors in a crowded banquet hall, or a fetching woman on a rope line.\n<p>If Clinton acted like someone who ran Capitol Records, Obama&#8212;both the person <em>and</em> the president&#8212;carries himself like Roger Federer, a merciless competitor who keeps coming and coming, only there’s a serenity about him that\ndisarms just about everyone. At one point during the hour I spent interviewing him at the White House this fall, he casually compared himself to Aaron Rodgers, and he wasn’t bragging. Obama identified with Rodgers’s ability to keep his focus downfield despite all the chaos happening in front of him. That’s Obama’s enduring quality,\nand (to borrow another sports term) this has been his “career year.”</p>\n<p>Obama lives in America’s most famous museum and uses it to his advantage. You’re sitting there in some ancient tearoom waiting for him to show up, surrounded by portraits of former first ladies and framed maps from battles\nthat America won over the centuries. Everyone is friendly but suspicious. Everyone talks in hushed tones. You feel like you’re intruding at all times. You’re just…waiting. Suddenly, ten anonymous security guards pop out of hallways\nand doorways that you didn’t know were there. The energy shifts. And then, there’s Obama&#8212;big smile, big handshake, some ball-busting comments to put everyone at ease. Within seconds of greeting me, he was poking fun at my shoes and teasing me for not writing anymore.</p>\n<p>“It’s really aggravating not having you on Grantland,” he said, almost like I betrayed him. “I go to the site and there’s no Simmons. Come on, man, it’s not the same.”</p>\n<p>It’s an alpha-male trick&#8212;put someone off-balance, flatter them and bust their chops at the same time. A few minutes later, he was grabbing control of the interview with measured responses, knowing that he didn’t have to perform\nwithout cameras or podcast equipment. And so he took his time. And it worked. I mean, how do you interrupt the most powerful man on earth? It felt like the way Federer repeatedly jumped Novak Djokovic’s second serve in the 2015 U.S. Open Final&#8212;a savvy trick to disrupt someone’s flow, a seemingly harmless way to gain an edge. It’s what the great competitors do.</p>\n<p>In January, Obama will begin his eighth and final year on the job. It’s an <em>era</em> now. What has he learned about leadership? What was his biggest regret? Why did it seem like, in 2015, he finally started letting it fly, threw on his Beefsquatch costume and let everyone know “THIS IS ME NOW!” Gay marriage, health care, Charleston, the Iran deal… If you voted against him, 2015 was the year when his inner confidence bothered you more than ever. And if you voted for him, 2015 was definitely the year when you said, “<em>That</em> is the guy I voted for.” But what if Barack Obama has been that guy all along?</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>BILL SIMMONS: If you could go back to 2008 and tell yourself one thing, what would it be?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>BARACK OBAMA:</strong> “You’re going to be busy.” Coming in, we were going through an unprecedented economic upheaval, combined with an upheaval in the Middle East that we hadn’t seen in our lifetimes. There was going\nto be a huge amount of disruption. I would probably tell myself to communicate more effectively early on than I did. We ran a great campaign. It wasn’t as great as it seems in retrospect&#8212;there’s always rose-colored glasses but there’s no doubt that we captured the country’s imagination. And somehow in those first two years, I think a certain arrogance crept in, in the sense of thinking as long as we get the policy ready, we didn’t have to sell it.</p>\n<p>One thing I learned through some tough election cycles: You can’t separate good policy from the need to bring the American people along and make sure that they know why you’re doing what you’re doing. And that’s particularly\ntrue now in this new communications era. I think that we were ahead of the curve in 2008 in social media and the Internet and digital communications. When we came into office, instead of taking some of those lessons, we\nsuddenly adapted ourselves to the White House press room and structures that had been built back in the 1940s and ’50s. As a consequence of those missteps early, we got the policies right, and that’s why the economy now has grown for five and a half straight years, six years, and why unemployment rates have gone from 10 percent to 5.1 percent. But there was a lot of political pain along the way that might not have been necessary.</p>\n<p><strong>Was there a point in those first three years where you started to feel overwhelmed by the job? Where you\nwere just like, “My God, I just had no idea this was going to be this hard!”</strong><br>\nI had a pretty good handle. One thing I learned during the campaign was that I’ve got a good temperament. I don’t get too high and I don’t get too low. I’m able to stay focused even when there’s a lot of stuff going on around me.</p>\n<p><strong>So you’re like Gregg Popovich. Although he does get mad at sideline reporters.</strong><br>\n<em>[laughs]</em> He does. So do I. <em>[laughs]</em> Yeah. Or maybe [Aaron] Rodgers in the pocket, in the sense of you can’t be distracted by what’s around you, you’ve got to be looking downfield. And I think that’s a quality that I have&#8212;not getting flustered in what’s around me. So there was never a point, even early on&#8212;even in the first six months, where we weren’t sure whether we were going to dip into another Great Depression, we weren’t sure whether the steps we were taking on rescuing the auto industry or stabilizing the financial system were going to work&#8212;there weren’t moments where I thought, “Sheesh, feels like we’re in over our head.”</p>\n<p>But what I didn’t fully appreciate, and nobody can appreciate until they’re in the position, is how decentralized power is in this system. When you’re in the seat and you’re seeing the housing market collapse and you are seeing unemployment skyrocketing and you have a sense of what the right thing to do is, then you realize, “Okay, not only do I have to persuade my own party, not only do I have to prevent the other party from blocking what the right thing to do is, but now I can anticipate this lawsuit, this lobbying taking place, and this federal agency that technically is independent, so I can’t tell them what to do. I’ve got the Federal Reserve, and I’m hoping that they do the right thing&#8212;and by the way, since the economy now is global, I’ve got to make sure that the Europeans, the Asians, the Chinese, everybody is on board.” A lot of the work is not just identifying the right policy but now constantly building these ever shifting coalitions to be able to actually implement and execute and get it done.</p>\n<p><strong>You’re out to dinner with your wife and the phone rings. How many of the people in your life are you like, “Uh-oh, I’ve got to take this”?</strong><br>\nMalia and Sasha. <em>[laughs]</em> And maybe my mother-in-law. My national security adviser, Susan Rice, and Denis McDonough, my chief of staff. Those are the only people whose call I would take during a date night with Michelle. But the entire White House is full of people who have enormous responsibilities. You can’t do this by yourself. The principle of team building in the White House is really no different than the principle of team building anywhere, on a sports team or a well-run business. Do they put team ahead of themselves? Do you make sure all the pieces fit together? Because just having the best athletes, if they’re knocking heads and nobody’s doing rebounding and everybody wants the ball, it isn’t always going to work.</p>\n<p><strong>Is it fair to say that in 2015, you’ve been like the second-semester high school senior who got into Yale and now is like, “I’m going out tonight&#8212;I don’t care if I have a test tomorrow”? All of us were kind of waiting for that guy to show up after he got re-elected. What took two years to get there?</strong><br>\nThere’s no doubt that the longer I’m in this job, the more confident I am about the decisions I’m making and more knowledgeable about the responses I can expect. And as a consequence, you end up being looser. There’s not much I have not seen at this point, and I know what to expect, and I can anticipate more than I did before.</p>\n<p>I [also] have a case to make now that was harder to make earlier in my presidency. We had confidence, for example, that the economic decisions that we made to stabilize the financial system and pass Wall Street reform and raise\ntaxes on the wealthiest and pass health care&#8212;that would have a payoff. But because we had been in such a deep hole, we had to be careful about crowing success when people weren’t feeling it. And it wasn’t really until around 2014 where the attitude of the American people was, “The economy’s improving, I’m feeling better.”</p>\n<p><strong>So you feed off that.</strong><br>\nYou can make your case without caveats, which, I think, hampered my ability to communicate confidence and optimism to people. You didn’t want people to feel as if you were getting ahead of yourself. It’s a combination of me feeling looser because I’ve just been in this job a long time and have gone through some tough stretches. Not only do you not look like you have any fear, but you actually <em>don’t</em> have any fear. And I don’t at this point. The bets we made early on have paid off. Some of it does have to do with luck.</p>\n<p>Think about 2013, right after I’d been re-elected: Our goal was to lead with a big push on immigration reform. And then, before the second inauguration has even happened, [the school shooting at] Sandy Hook happens. Which remains, by the way, the worst few days of my presidency. I went up and visited with those families and&#8212;you know, Bill, you’ve still got small kids. These are 6-year-olds, right? And you have 20 of them who’ve been massacred. Right away, our focus had to shift to “Is there a way for us to capture this moment to see if we can get over this incredible hump to try to put in place some common-sense gun-safety rules?” And we knew it was a stretch, just because of the politics of Congress and the NRA. But we had to try.</p>\n<p>And throughout 2013 and 2014, you had a series of events like that&#8212;the Snowden disclosures, Ebola, Ferguson, ISIL, and unaccompanied children coming across the borders&#8212;all sort of stacked up in a row. None of them individually unsolvable, but given the 24/7 news cycle, they just sort of pile up on each other. Even though, in the midst of this, the economy is improving and we are making real progress on education and health care and energy and so forth, political momentum turns sharply against you. And so we’ve had more than our share of stormy seas, but we’ve navigated the ship well.</p>\n<p><strong>When Ferguson happened last year, I was waiting for Obama the Person to come in. But you had to be President Obama. How you handled Charleston this year and Selma&#8212;that was Obama the Person. So what happened with Ferguson? Do you wish you had handled that differently?</strong><br>\nYou know, the challenge of Ferguson and all issues related to police shootings, race, and the criminal-justice system is that in order to actually get something done, you have to build consensus. Expressing simple outrage without\nfollow-up is often counterproductive. In the case of Ferguson, I’m the attorney general’s boss. If I chime in with a strong opinion about what’s happened, not only do I stand to potentially damage subsequent law-enforcement cases, but immediately you get blowback and backlash that may make people less open to listening. What was different in Charleston was the clarity of what happened&#8212;that allowed, I think, everybody to be open to it.</p>\n<p><strong>Did it take time during the presidency to realize what kind of moments those were?</strong><br>\nYes, sometimes it’s feel. Sometimes the circumstances won’t give you a clean statement. The fact that race has always been the fault line of our society and has always distorted our politics&#8212;that is not subject to argument. Part of what you’re looking for is a way not to just vent but to actually move the people. I practiced law for a while&#8212;a lot of times, hard cases can make bad law. If you have an issue that you want to put forward, you’re looking for the right plaintiff and the right court to appear before. I do think as you go on as president, you get a better feel for this, but you’re not always going to be perfect. When the Trayvon Martin case happened, I had an honest response as a father that I think resonated with a lot of people. When Ferguson happened, there was a gap between how quickly we could pull together a police task force, recommendations. And so in that lag, it feels as if I haven’t spoken to the moment as effectively. I suspect that if I were to do it over again, there might be something I could say that would’ve crystallized it more effectively. But Ferguson&#8212;the case itself was tougher because people didn’t know what was going on exactly. In some ways the [Eric] Garner case in New York was clearer because you had on videotape exactly what had happened, and some of the subsequent cases have been more obvious.</p>\n<p>One thing you learn as president is you’re not always going to perform flawlessly and you have to be able to put that out of your mind and then look at the next problem coming down the pipe. If I’m working out in the gym, sometimes I’ll go to NBA Classics and watch some of these old classic games&#8212;</p>\n<p><strong>The lack of HD really hurts&#8212;you can barely see anybody.</strong><br>\nIt’s true&#8212;and the graphics at the bottom are terrible. But a thing that you’re reminded of, watching those old Bulls games, is Jordan had some stinker games in the playoffs. But he would get that out of his mind, and then the next moment comes and he’s right there. He could have a terrible game for the first three quarters and then suddenly go crazy the fourth. Or he might miss a free throw, and then the next play is he’s stealing the ball and hitting the game-winning shot. Part of what I try to do&#8212;not at the level that Jordan did on the basketball court, but part of what you aspire to as president or any of these positions of leadership&#8212;is to try to figure out how to be in the moment, make the best decision you can, know that you’re going to get a bunch of them right, but a bunch of times you’re also not going to get it exactly the way you want it.</p>\n<p><strong>You win the election in 2008, and Twitter is just becoming a thing. Over the course of your presidency, that’s the biggest thing that’s changed. What’s the biggest challenge with all that stuff?</strong><br>\nSpeed. You are on 24/7&#8212;you have to respond immediately. The job of our office, to keep up and to respond quickly to anything that’s happening but not be consumed by it, is completely different. We’ve been building a digital team inside the White House.</p>\n<p><strong>When did that start?</strong><br>\nToo late. That’s an example of something that I would’ve started earlier. That was a lesson that coming out of the first term, I should’ve understood. That’s why we built this team. It’s so interesting watching my daughters. Both are complete ninjas on the phone, right? And they can do things that I don’t even understand&#8212;they’re doing it in two seconds. But I even see a difference between Malia, who’s 17, and Sasha, who’s 14. There’s almost a mini-generational gap in terms of Sasha being so connected seamlessly to this smartphone in a way that Malia, who was already a little bit older when it really started to take, is not.</p>\n<p><strong>The ability to multitask with 19 different friends at the same time…</strong><br>\nYeah. And just the degree to which her social life is so connected to that. So it’s not just having to change how we do business inside the White House to react to stories, but also, how do we tell a story about issues to constituencies that are completely splintered, who don’t watch television in the same way, who don’t watch the news in the same way? In some ways we’re just laying the foundation for what I assume will be the standard practice of future presidents.</p>\n<p><strong>Gun control: You’ve tried to legislate it as much as you possibly could and hit a wall basically in every direction. But the one thing Hillary Clinton has brought up is executive action.</strong><br>\nWell, keep in mind that after Sandy Hook, we put forward 23 executive actions. So we haven’t been asleep at the switch in terms of executive actions that we’ve tried. There are maybe a few more that had to be scrubbed by lawyers because, essentially, with every executive action, we can count on it being challenged by somebody in Congress or, in this case, the NRA. We want to make any executive action we take as defensible as possible legally. In the absence of a movement politically in which people say, “Enough is enough,” we’re going to continue to see, unfortunately, these tragedies take place. The main thing that I’ve been trying to communicate over the last several of these horrific episodes is that, contrary to popular belief, Americans are not more violent than people in other developed countries. But they have more deadly weapons to act out their rage, and that’s the only main variable that you see between the U.S. and these other countries.</p>\n<p><strong>It does feel like it’s going to become the dominant issue of year eight.</strong><br>\nI hope so. We have this weird habit in this culture of mourning and, you know, 48, 72 hours of wall-to-wall coverage, and then…suddenly we move on. And I will do everything I can to make sure that there’s a sustained attention paid to this thing.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s the most entertaining conspiracy theory you ever read about yourself?</strong><br>\nThat military exercises we were doing in Texas were designed to begin martial law so that I could usurp the Constitution and stay in power longer. Anybody who thinks I could get away with telling Michelle I’m going to be president any longer than eight years does not know my wife.</p>\n<p><strong>Have you ever said, “Give me the JFK-assassination files, I want to read them. Give me all the secret stuff”?</strong><br>\nI gotta tell you, it’s a little disappointing. People always ask me about Roswell and the aliens and UFOs, and it turns out the stuff going on that’s top secret isn’t nearly as exciting as you expect. In this day and age, it’s not as top secret as you’d think.</p>\n<p><strong>Would you ever want to be a Supreme Court justice?</strong><br>\n<em>[pauses]</em></p>\n<p><strong>You paused!</strong><br>\nNo&#8212;well, the reason I paused for a second was just to make sure that I let people know that I think good judges are really important, and Supreme Court justices, obviously, are hugely important. I don’t have the temperament to sit in relative solitude and just opine and write from the bench. I want to be in the action a little bit more.</p>\n<p><strong>Is it true you have a virtual driving range in the White House?</strong><br>\nTrue.</p>\n<p><strong>It’s in the bowels of the White House?</strong><br>\nYeah, I mean, this is not like some super-fancy thing. But I can hit these Wiffle balls.</p>\n<p><strong>So you go down there and hit, like as a stress reliever?</strong><br>\nYeah. Just whack ’em. Whack ’em around a little bit.</p>\n<p><strong>Has anyone come to the White House and picked up your older daughter for a date?</strong><br>\nNo, but I’ve seen some folks glancing at her in ways that made me not happy.</p>\n<p><strong>Tell the Secret Service, “Just take out that guy over there”?</strong><br>\n“Just keep an eye on him.”</p>\n<p><strong>Does it scare you that your wife could have a billion-dollar daytime talk show and you could be Stedman 2.0?</strong><br>\n<em>[laughs]</em> Uh…</p>\n<p><strong>Because that’s in play. She could do that if she wanted.</strong><br>\nAnd if that’s what she wants to do, I’m okay with her making a whole lot of money. There’s nothing wrong with that.</p>\n<p><strong>Would you ever want to be part of the ownership for an NBA team?</strong><br>\nAbsolutely.</p>\n<p><strong>Would it have to be the Bulls, or would it have to be somebody else?</strong><br>\nWell, you know, I know [Jerry] Reinsdorf pretty good&#8212;he’s not giving that thing up anytime soon. But I have fantasized about being able to put together a team and how much fun that would be. I think it’d be terrific.</p>\n<p><strong>How many times have you said to your kids, “Stop Googling me”?</strong><br>\nI don’t have to tell them that. They have no interest in me. I mean, they’re hopefully interested in me as a father.</p>\n<p><strong>Not as a public figure. What’s your guiltiest-pleasure TV show? Don’t say <em>Game of Thrones</em>, because that’s a good show.</strong><br>\nProbably the guiltiest pleasure&#8212;and this is kind of lame&#8212;is <em>Big Break</em>. You know, on the Golf Channel? Which is kind of a silly show. <em>[laughs]</em> But I find it really relaxing.</p>\n<p><strong>So you watch it on the treadmill or something?</strong><br>\nYeah, when I’m working out sometimes late at night. I never see all the episodes, but if they’ve got some chipping contest or something… <em>[laughs]</em> It’s pretty lame. I do love <em>Game of Thrones</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Which character do you identify with?</strong><br>\nMy favorite character is probably…the dwarf, what’s his name?</p>\n<p><strong>Oh, yeah. Peter Dinklage’s character.</strong><br>\nThe problem with <em>Game of Thrones,</em> though, is that I don’t remember the names of any of the characters.</p>\n<p><strong>I don’t, either.</strong><br>\nI remember the characters, so when I watch it, I know exactly what’s going on. But if you read a review of the show afterwards and they’re mentioning such and such, the only one I remember is Jon Snow, because I can pronounce Jon Snow.</p>\n<p><strong>Which <em>Game of Thrones</em> character is Donald Trump?</strong><br>\nUh…I don’t think…I don’t think any of them rise to that level.</p>\n<p><strong>If you were campaigning against Trump, would you even bother? Would it be like LaBradford Smith talking trash to Jordan or something?</strong><br>\nI would’ve enjoyed campaigning against Trump. That would’ve been fun.</p>\n<p><strong>Which leadership style suits your vision of where America should go forward? Biden or Hillary?</strong><br>\n<em>[laughs]</em> Come on, Bill.</p>\n<p><strong>I had to ask you one thing you can’t answer! Here’s one you have to answer: Who’s more untradable, Derrick Rose or Jay Cutler?</strong><br>\n<em>[pause]</em> Oh, I think Rose still has more upside. Remember, Rose is still awfully young.</p>\n<p><strong>So you haven’t given up on Rose?</strong><br>\nI’ve not given up on him. Sadly, I think it’s hard to imagine, after that many injuries, him getting back to his MVP-season performance. But he can still be a top-ten point guard.</p>\n<p><strong>Baseball, football, basketball, all the commissioner jobs open up next year. Which one would you want?</strong><br>\nWell, I’m best suited for basketball. But I cannot believe that the commissioner of football gets paid\n$44 million a year.</p>\n<p><strong>When you said, “I cannot believe…,” I didn’t know where you were going with that. Have you thought about calling <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/roger-goodell-season-from-hell\">Roger Goodell</a> and being like, “What are you <em>doing?</em> Can I help you?” [<em>Obama laughs</em>.] “Can I give you some advice? Want to have dinner?”</strong><br>\nThey’re making a profit, and I think that’s what the owners are most concerned with.</p>\n<p><strong>So you think the owners like having him there?</strong><br>\nYou’re not going to drag me into your fights, man. Come on&#8212;I’ve got enough fights of my own. <em>[laughs]</em> This is between you and Roger.</p>\n<p><strong>Number of cigarettes you’ve smoked in the White House since you got here?</strong><br>\nZero in the last five years. I made a promise that once health care passed, I would never have a cigarette again. And I have not.</p>\n<p><strong>What perk of being president are you going to miss the most?</strong><br>\nSo the clear answer would be Air Force One: an amazing plane with an amazing crew, they clear out airspace so you don’t have to wait. And you land anytime, you leave anytime. But it may be Marine One, because even post presidency, I may be able to round up a private plane sometime, but it’s tough not to have your helicopter waiting for you. <em>[laughs]</em></p>\n<p><strong>The last time I talked to you, you had one teenage daughter.</strong><br>\nNow I have two.</p>\n<p><strong>I’m two years away. Is it better, worse, or the same than what you expected when everybody told you, “Oh, just wait&#8212;just wait till they’re teenagers”?</strong><br>\nMy daughters are amazing girls. They’re smart, they’re funny. They take after their mom, and Michelle’s done a great job with them. You get these teenage moments&#8212;they love you, but what I think really affects you most is they just don’t have time for you. It’s not an active disdain for you. It’s just their calendars start filling up and they’ve got all\nthese friends who are much more interesting.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h2>The 14 Best Photos from the White House Flickr Account</h2>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Yeah, you’re not the coolest person in their lives anymore.</strong><br>\nAnd you just have to let go, you have to acknowledge that if you say to them, “Hey, you want to go watch this movie?” or “Hey, you want to go take a swim at the pool?” “No, sorry, Daddy. I love you, though. See you tomorrow, ’cause I’m spending the night at somebody’s house.” The golden age is between, say, 6, 7, and 12, and they’re your buddies and they just want to hang out. And after that, they will love you, but they don’t have that much time for you. And my understanding is, based on friends of mine who have older kids, is that with a little bit of luck, as long as you’re not so completely annoying during these teenage years, they’ll come back to you around 23, 24, and actually want to hang out with you. But that stretch is painful. The compensation you get for the fact that they don’t have time for you is: Nothing beats watching your children become smarter and cooler than you are. And you suddenly will hear them say something or make a joke or have an insight and you go,\n“Wow. I didn’t think of that.”</p>\n<p><strong>Are they ready for you to be the ex-president?</strong><br>\nNot as much as Michelle, but certainly ready.</p>\n<p><strong>Oh, Michelle’s the leader of the power rankings?</strong><br>\nOh, absolutely. There are clear rankings. Michelle. Malia and Sasha, they’re constantly wrestling for second place. I rank ahead of the dogs.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Bill Simmons</strong> <em>is the founder of Grantland, the co-creator of ESPN’s</em> 30 for 30 <em>sports documentary series, and the best-selling author of</em> The Book of Basketball. <em>He is currently creating his own show for HBO, which will premiere next spring.</em></p>","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"channels":[{"id":"59b038ed0a8d2f0976474f19","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Culture","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"culture"}],"franchises":[{"id":"59b038eedd663e6940cf161b","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Men Of The Year","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"men-of-the-year"}],"famous-people":[{"id":"59b038ecdd663e6940cf158f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Bill Simmons","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"bill-simmons"},{"id":"59b038eb7246eb56980ac792","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Barack Obama","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"barack-obama"}],"topics":[{"id":"59b038ecf667492236d9173f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Politics","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"politics"}]},"channel":"News & Culture","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"56424a0aa3bd50211a99bd7c","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","email":"Bill_Simmons@condenast.com","name":"Bill Simmons","socialMedia":[]}]},"dek":"The leader of the free world sits down with the free agent of the year&#8212;HBO’s Bill Simmons&#8212;to discuss the Obama era and beyond.

bus tells you everything you need to know because the bus is a piece of shit. You would expect a Donald Trump campaign bus to be MOST LUXURIOUS, MOST DESIRED, NUMBER ONE BUS in the world, with a solid-gold chassis and marble toilets and a rooftop fuck cabana. This is not that bus. “It’s just a bus,” one Trump staffer told me, which is exactly right. It’s an old cross-country bus that still smells like an old cross-country bus, only it’s painted blue, with the name TRUMP in huge letters across both sides, plus the campaign hashtag <em>#Make America Great Again!</em> Trump says he has copyrighted it (“I’m using that a lot, and I think it’s a great statement”) even though you can’t actually put exclamation points or spaces in a hashtag.\n<p>The bus is basically a rolling version of Trump’s Atlantic City: it’s built to look nice for a single day, then it falls into disrepair the moment you’ve stopped paying attention. From a distance, though, the bus looks like a monument. You see the name, and you take in everything that name connotes&#8212;wealth, ego, poor taste&#8212;and the bus has done its job. This is Trump’s bus, and it dominates the landscape the moment it arrives. People from all around take selfies near it. Why? Because TRUMP, that’s why.</p>\n<p>And the bus is working. Perhaps you’ve noticed&#8212;or perhaps you’re trying not to notice&#8212;but Donald Trump is leading all current Republican candidates in the national polls, and his lead is growing. And so it doesn’t really matter whether you see this as an alarming sign of the nation’s growing lunacy, or as a reckoning for a GOP that has been awash for years in hateful rhetoric, or as a byproduct of Trump’s masterful ability to hijack all political coverage by embracing his role as America’s Master Idiot. He’s doing it. At least for a brief moment, he’s winning. And he may extend his lead once the GOP debates begin Thursday night. Trump has managed to plaster his name all over this election as if it were one of his overpriced condos, and he has drawn the crowds as a result.</p>\n<p>And these are real voters out here who are responding to him: real voters who are lining up for his rallies in large numbers (not as large as Trump claims, but still!), real voters who hang on every word of his ridiculous pitch for how he will wheel and deal America back to the top.</p>\n<p>But who the fuck are these people? Are they blind? Are they crazy? Have they been brainwashed by all the giant signs? Or is it possible they see something in Trump that the rest of us don’t? What makes someone want to seriously consider voting for this man? I didn’t know what the answer was, but I wanted to see for myself. I needed to make it make sense. So I went to Iowa&#8212;Iowa: The State You Grew Up Swearing You’d Leave One Day!™&#8212;to meet them. And to see The Donald in the flesh.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Every election dispatch from Iowa is required to include a bit of scenery-setting, to show you just how folksy Iowa is: corn, state fairs, dragonflies, balloon museums, smiling fat babies, etc.</p>\n<p>This is not the Iowa I visited. The Donald Trump Make America Great Again Rally and Family Picnic was held in Oskaloosa, a small town 60 miles east of Des Moines. Oskaloosa is like a lot of small Midwestern towns right now: crumbling houses, shuttered businesses, half-empty strip malls.  You are surrounded by loss here. One of the few thriving businesses I saw in town, apart from a kickass bar called The Cellar Peanut Pub, was a video store. An actual video store. They didn’t even have to rent porn to stay solvent. They had customers, <em>and</em> they were hiring.</p>\n<p>Oskaloosa has been left behind in the Information Age. What has left here is never coming back, no matter what any politician or businessman promises. And people in Osky&#8212;the locals call it “Osky”&#8212;don’t look pleased about this. Contrary to friendly Midwestern stereotypes, they look PISSED. Every man I saw in town looked like your father-in-law the first time you met him at the door. Out on the empty roads, the only vehicles are big, angry pickup trucks with huge side mirrors sticking way out, like they wanna punch your car. People here are aggrieved. People here have had a lot of disappointment, and they are sick of it.</p>\n<p>Like Karen and Diane. Along with a bunch of friends and family, they showed up early this morning to the 696-seat George Daily Community Auditorium (which Oskaloosa’s middle school and high school share) so they could get as close to their billionaire savior as possible. To “see the color of his eyes,” Diane said. I greeted their group as they waited by the door, many of them sitting in nylon golf chairs, nervous about losing their spot in line.</p>\n<p>“I like that Trump won’t back down,” Karen told me. “He says what he means and he means what he’s saying. He ain’t going to say he’s sorry. Sometimes he likes to say things not politically correct, but they all better get used to that. The people who do speak politically correct have been losers.”</p>\n<p>“They constipated America!” Diane said, rocking a House of Blues t-shirt. “What we have had is politicians and lawyers who have constipated America. Let’s get a businessman in there and get things moving! We need our new MiraLAX!”</p>\n<p><em>Do you believe everything Trump says?</em></p>\n<p>“At this point, I’m inclined to say he’s not lying.”</p>\n<p><em>Do you think he exaggerates sometimes?</em></p>\n<p>“Oh yeah. Who doesn’t?”</p>\n<p>“He is for America,” Karen says. “He is for the elderly. He is for the quiet people.”</p>\n<p>Who are “<em>the quiet people</em>”?</p>\n<p>“The people like us, that a lot of times walk around with the attitude that, ‘Oh, it doesn’t matter what I think. I’m just from Osky.’ You know? <em>The quiet people</em>. The people who don’t think they have a voice.”</p>\n<p>Karen used to live in Arizona, where she had a job at a semiconductor plant, adding gold buttons to each chip in on anassembly line. But the plant was relocated to China, and so she lost her job and relocated here. As you could probably surmise, she likes Trump’s tough talk about foreigners stealing our jobs. I had arrived in Iowa just as Trump was doubling down on his comments that Mexico was sending “rapists” across our border; people here loved it, and seemed oddly emotional about the subject of immigration, even though Iowa is nowhere near the border. Apparently, it’s not just the immigrants from <em>Mexico</em> that concern Iowans for Trump. “We need to get the Muslims out of the country,” a man named Bob with a swirling white beard told me, “before they start killing our families!” Everyone around him nodded.</p>\n<p>The line to see Trump grew longer and stretched across the front of Oskaloosa middle school. A local Hy-Vee supermarket put up picnic tables and gave away bottled water, potato salad, pulled pork, and hot dogs thick as flashlights. Elderly people tooted around on Rascal scooters. An enterprising man hocked all-purpose GOP fanboy buttons with slogans like BENGHAZI MATTERS.</p>\n<p>I met an old couple wearing matching Trump t-shirts, which they told me they wore every day. “I haven’t had one bad comment on it,” said the wife. I met a man named Wayne who voted for Obama twice but was now firmly in Trump’s corner. I met ANOTHER man named Wayne who walked me carefully through his five-point rationale for why Trump was the best candidate. (Voters often show up at these rallies with little stump speeches of their own.) I met a woman named Jill who showed up with several hand-drawn signs. (My favorite was “Beltway Talks; Trump Works.”) Jill was <em>fired the fuck up</em> for some Trump in her life. I don’t know how it’s possible to be so fired up with the election so far away, but Jill was <em>blazing</em>. She wanted to make sure the whole world knew that Trump and his voters were for real.</p>\n<p>“I was terribly insulted when [John McCain] called us crazies,” Jill told me.</p>\n<p><em>What is it that you like so much about Trump?</em></p>\n<p>“He’s a capitalist,” Jill explained. “That inspires me.”</p>\n<p>I also ran into a very rare minority in the crowd&#8212;a Pakistani woman who emigrated here from Pakistan 40 years ago and didn’t like the idea of anyone skirting the naturalization process.</p>\n<p>“I came in the right way,” she told me. “When you try to do things the right way, it doesn’t work. And all these illegals sneaking in, and being able to stay&#8212;how do they get to do that?”</p>\n<p><em>And you think Trump will make things fairer</em>.</p>\n<p>“Well, as long as he does a better job than what’s being done. You know?”</p>\n<p>A nervous drug counselor named Tracy was also in line to see Trump. Unlike some of the others, she had some concerns about him. Well, one: “He’s an atheist,” she said.</p>\n<p>A man nearby overheard us talking and told us he shared her worry. “We have to elect godly men.”</p>\n<p>But Jill&#8212;the sign lady&#8212;cut into the conversation and came to the rescue: “He’s not an atheist. I wanted to correct that. He explained the church he’s gone to his whole life. He didn’t articulate it as well as he should have. But you know what? That articulation&#8212;I’m not concerned with that.”</p>\n<p>That seemed to cool Tracy’s hangups about Trump being a godless heathen.</p>\n<p>And I spotted a woman pushing around a stroller with a photograph of a live abortion taped to it, along with a big sign that read “DEAR PLANNED PARENTHOOD, I AM NOT FOR SALE.” For some reason, the woman ditched the stroller in the middle of the path leading to the auditorium, and a squat veteran named Randy went to alert the police. “That’s a good way to get a bomb brought in,” he said. While we all stared at the stroller, looking for any suspicious bulges (it turned out to be clean), Randy explained to me why he had a big ol’ Trump-on.</p>\n<p>“I like what he has to say. He won’t take no shit from nobody.”</p>\n<p><em>What’s your favorite thing he’s said?</em></p>\n<p>“You’re fired!”</p>\n<p><em>Who would you like him to fire, besides Obama?</em></p>\n<p>“Let’s see: John Kerry, our last governor, the attorney general, every Muslim that they put in…”</p>\n<p>Randy seemed untroubled by Trump’s lack of polish, or knowledge, or basic human grace. Far from it&#8212;these were virtues. “You don’t have to be a brain to run a business,” Randy said. “Just an ass. Sometimes you can be nice and polite, but there’s sometimes you’ve just got to be a horse’s ass with somebody to get them to do what they’re supposed to be doing.”</p>\n<p>So far, I’d heard Trump compared&#8212;favorably&#8212;to a horse’s ass and to a laxative, and I began to imagine a Trump campaign poster that was just a big horse’s butthole spewing hot diarrhea.</p>\n<p><em>So you believe Trump has the fearlessness to run this country?</em></p>\n<p>“I know he does,” said Randy. “Have you ever watched <em>The Apprentice?</em>”</p>\n<p>I talked to more voters and a pattern emerged in the answers. Trump was “honest,” “not PC,” “authentic,” “shooting from the hip,” and “called a spade a spade.” And of course, he wasn’t from Washington. He was gonna get in there and shake things up.</p>\n<p>We’ve heard all of this before, from many, many other candidates. Every presidential election has at least one magical, imaginary OUTSIDER&#8212;that teenage wet dream of a president who rides into Washington, tells those bureaucrats what shitheads they are, and bulldozes Congress into doing cool shit simply with the power of his huge cock. I have fallen for this kind of candidate. YOU have fallen for this kind of candidate. Everybody wants this mythical Bulworth to exist, but at this level of politics, there are no outsiders, and the game changes its rules for no one.</p>\n<p>And yet, people buy in. Maybe this time, they think, the guy who says he’s different really is different.</p>\n<p>And Trump, to his credit, is definitely different.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Noon was approaching and the doors to the auditorium opened. Trump supporters poured into seats in front of the stage and onto a set of risers behind the podium. The hated media&#8212;that would include me&#8212;sat toward the back.</p>\n<p>After a couple of introductory speeches from a local politician and a member of Seal Team Seven (not Six, but Seven&#8212;they’re one better!), we were greeted by former <em>Apprentice</em> runner-up Tana Goertz, who also happens to be Trump 2016’s Iowa co-chair and a “well-known Bedazzler spokeswoman.”</p>\n<p>“We all know how much Donald Trump is worth!” Goertz cried out, inaccurately. “How much?” The response from the crowd was messy and overlapping&#8212;many wild guesses called out at once.</p>\n<p>“I’ve met a lot of smart people,” Goertz continued, undaunted, “but I have never met a man that thinks about working when other people are talking about working.”</p>\n<p><em>Wait, what?</em></p>\n<p>“At the heart of it all, he’s a builder. Who better than Donald Trump to rebuild this country?”</p>\n<p>Okay, that’s a metaphor I can get behind.</p>\n<p>“You have never ever in your life experienced what you’re about to experience today. I’m just going to say: Sit back, put on your seatbelt. It’s going to be a fun ride. You will enjoy the experience and the ride, which is Donald Trump.”</p>\n<p>Finally&#8212;after a quick Pledge of Allegiance&#8212;the man himself emerged through a side door, carried aloft by the strains of Joe Esposito’s “You’re The Best.”</p>\n<p>I saw the hair first. It arrived in two parts: first the Turtle Wax-ed strands that run along both sides of his scalp, then the champagne glitter yarn kit perched top. I’d never seen Trump before, and the hair was all that I’d hoped for, and more. And after announcing his intention to molest all of Iowa’s chief export (“I want to grab that corn like you’ve never seen&#8212;so beautiful”) the ride started up.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>I’m gonna say a few nice things about Donald Trump now. If that terrifies you, then by all means, skim through this section and carry on with your existence.</p>\n<p>But I must tell you that, in person, Donald Trump is a very entertaining public speaker. And is this really such a surprise? Ever since* The Art of the Deal*, Trump has spent decades giving speeches all over the country, acting as our Get-Rich-Quick godfather. When he gets in front of a microphone, he requires no notes. No teleprompter. He is confident. He is casual. He is charming. Everyone is a “great guy” or an “amazing negotiator.”</p>\n<p>He can even be funny. When I texted a friend from the event that Trump was hilarious in person, he texted back, “NO. No no no.” Sorry, it’s true. It’s still not clear whether he’s in on the joke&#8212;there’s always been a bit of mystery to how aware Donald Trump is that Donald Trump is full of shit. But when you see him in person, and you hear him claim that the term “Supreme Leader” would be more fitting for him than for the head of Iran, there is the tiniest hint that he knows what a ludicrous thing this is to say. Even his exaggerations are hilarious. He said this was the biggest crowd in state history, even though we were in a public-school auditorium. He said he was worth more than $10 billion, a figure that is impossible for him to prove but also impossible for us to disprove. He said he made $213 million from <em>The Apprentice</em>, a figure which NBC steadfastly refutes.</p>\n<p>At one point, Trump boasted about how much veterans adore him. To prove it, he trotted out a gorgeous brunette who was carrying a perfect stack of white paper topped with a bow. I swear it looked like an unwrapped package of blank Hammermill printer paper. “In one day,” Trump blared, “many hundreds of letters from Vietnam vets, thanking me. This is from veterans. Each page, a different letter. It’s amazing.”</p>\n<p>Everyone ate it up. They laughed and cheered and hollered out in approval all through his speech.  It was more like a late-night monologue, and true to his reputation, Trump is not careful with his words. You can see why people think he’s more “honest” than one of the other randos in the GOP field&#8212;he’s gifted at not sounding like a politician even as he deploys standard tricks from the “I’m not a politician” handbook. He is definitely more fun to watch than Bobby Jindal. I wish there were more Trump-like candidates out there who are not Donald Trump, if that makes any sense.</p>\n<p>He also made a good point or two in between all the noise. At one point he bellowed: “I read Jeb Bush raised over a hundred million dollars. Now if you think that those people giving him all those money aren’t getting a lot, you’re wrong. All of these people are controlled by the people who gave them their money.” He’s right! It’s true! Holy shit, Donald Trump said a true thing. I heard it with my own two ears.</p>\n<p>If Donald Trump has one undeniable virtue as a politician, it’s that he does not try to fake being one of us. He’s not going to the fucking Bowl-o-Rama on a Saturday night in a plaid shirt to prove he’s a man of the people. The whole thrust of The Donald’s campaign is that he is special. He is extraordinary. In Osky, he compared his business acumen to Jack Nicklaus’ golfing ability and Babe Ruth’s hitting ability. (“It’s called talent. <em>Talent</em>.”) He is a WINNER, and he is here to help this nation of sad losers learn how to win again.</p>\n<p>“We don’t win anymore in this country,” he told the crowd. “When was the last time we won? When did we beat China in a deal? We don’t win.”</p>\n<p>Well, Trump is here to fix all that losing. And here is where my brief jag of mildly effusive praise for Donald Trump must come to an end, because the grim undercurrent of his rise is SHAME.  After all, if you believe we must make America great again, then you must also believe that America, at the present moment, sucks. And pretty much everyone at the Trump picnic believed that America sucks. When I asked a group of Trump supporters outside if they were proud of America, they all laughed with derision. <em>Of course</em> they weren’t proud of America. Of course this nation is a shithole. One voter named Corey told me he hoped Trump would help America “get back to the way it was,” a refrain I heard from a lot of people, as if the country was a rock band that had changed its sound. Backing Trump means acknowledging that you live in a world of failure, and that your last best hope is the Music Man moseying into town.</p>\n<p>Now, here is how Donald Trump says he will Make America Great Again™. In Trump’s worldview, politics is little more than series of deals to be made. Every complex global problem, or intractable adversary, can be tamed with sufficiently hard-ass steakhouse dealmaking. He explained it all in Osky:</p>\n<p>“I know the greatest negotiators in the world,” he said. “Now some of these people are horrible human beings. You wouldn’t have them to dinner. They’re vicious. They’re crude. They’re unhappy. They treat everybody badly. Who cares? I want them negotiating against China. Think of Carl Icahn, a friend of mine. He’d be great. I’d say, ‘Carl, take China’.”</p>\n<p>Now, people applauded this, which alarmed me because (A) Who has friends like this? And (B) Sending a vicious, crude, unhappy person who treats everyone badly to go yell FUCK YOU at the Chinese strikes me as unwise.</p>\n<p>But Trump is so certain, so supremely confident, that everyone at his rallies go for the idea anyway. It comes off as an act of counterintuitive genius. What’s not to like about the idea that you can fix everything by just marching into Washington and yelling at all the dummies to stop being dummies? I wish politics were that simple. I really do. Politics <em>should</em> be that simple. Trump’s gift is that he really can make it sound that easy, even when it’s all a huge lie. His swagger is <em>your</em> swagger. He can reduce entire countries down to a cardboard persona. He’ll get tough with Mexico. He’ll have Carl take China. The way Trump explains it, you’d think China had only one person in it.</p>\n<p>Trump is so certain of his horseshit that, on that stage in Osky, he laid out a remarkable future scenario of him in the Oval Office that was essentially one enormous lie that hasn’t had the chance to become a lie yet. Here now is what President Trump would do if Ford tried to build a manufacturing plant down in Mexico:</p>\n<p>“It’s so easy. <em>It’s too easy</em>. I do it with a phone call. I call the head of Ford, and I say, ‘Every single car and truck that comes into the US, we’re going to tax you 35 percent’.”</p>\n<p>Massive applause! Trump wasn’t done.</p>\n<p>“So this isn’t 99.9 percent&#8212;this is <em>one hundred percent</em> what’s going to happen: He’ll call me back, probably that afternoon, but he may play it tough and call me back the next day. The next day I’ll get a call from Ben Ford”&#8212;NOTE: there is no Ben Ford; I assume he meant Bill&#8212;“and he’ll say, ‘Mr. President, we decided not to build that plant. We’ll build it in the United States.’”</p>\n<p>And everyone in the joint bought it! They damn near broke their hands clapping for this idea! I almost bought it myself! At least, I did for half a second before I thought, <em>Wait, don’t you need Congress to approve shit like that? And wouldn’t forcing the plant to be built here increase the cost of Fords? And then wouldn’t people stop buying Fords? And then wouldn’t Ford go belly up, costing us even MORE jobs than if we had just left the goddamn plant in Mexico? And what about the many, many Fords that are already produced in Mexico?</em></p>\n<p>But a Trump rally isn’t about thinking more than half a second ahead. There is a first BOLD step, and then you are left to assume that everything else will fall neatly into place. In Trump’s white-trash, Louis XIV universe, all you see is the pretty gold paint before it starts chipping off the walls.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Money, ironically, is what will likely wind up being Trump’s political downfall. Once the primary field has been winnowed down to a few schlubs, the GOP establishment will dump its funds into a single candidate with the goal of overtaking Trump, whom they all despise. (Yet one more reason why voters here love him, by the way.) And as rich Trump may claim to be, there are limits to how much of his personal fortune he’ll spend on this effort.</p>\n<p>Once the GOP muscles him out, Trump may very well run a third-party campaign that divides conservative voters and all but hands the 2016 election to a waiting Hillary Clinton. In Osky, this was every thinking Trump voter’s nightmare scenario. “As long as he doesn’t split parties, I’m there,” one attendee told me. “If he does that, it’s too important of an election.” But it could happen. And if it does, Trump may go from the darling of far-right conservatives voters to their most-hated nemesis.</p>\n<p>At the end of Trump’s speech, “We’re Not Gonna Take It” by Twisted Sister boomed through the speakers and played him off the stage.  The crowd grave him a standing O on his way out. The ride was over. The reviews outside were glowing: “Awesome.” “I loved his demeanor.” “Solutions.” “It’s nice to hear somebody talk who’s not a politician.” They were all sold. They were all going to home to preach the gospel of their King Midas.</p>\n<p>As I watched everyone file out, I thought of a moment during Tana Goertz’s opening-act speech earlier in the day, when she pleaded with everyone to eat more of the food outside. “Mr. Trump can’t take all this food home on the plane,” she told us. “There’s not enough room.” And so as all of Trump’s energized constituents filed out of the joint, I pictured him getting onto his plane, cigar in the corner of his mouth, jetting back to the Land of Winners. And I pictured everyone else stuck back here in Osky, with nothing but the scraps he left behind for all the quiet people.</p>","categories":{"channels":[{"id":"59b038ed0a8d2f0976474f19","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Culture","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"culture"}],"famous-people":[{"id":"59b038eddd663e6940cf1605","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"}],"topics":[{"id":"59b038ed7246eb56980ac830","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Election","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"election"},{"id":"59b038ecf667492236d9173f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Politics","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"politics"}]},"channel":"News & Culture","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"558285b9e52bc4b477a968a5","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","name":"Drew Magary","socialMedia":[{"network":"Twitter","handle":"@drewmagary"}]}]},"dek":"America is constipated, says one Trump supporter&#8212;and The Donald?

then, in 2005, it didn’t seem odd that she and Donald Trump would mark their happy occasion with the former president and First Lady, then a senator from New York. “When they went to our wedding, we were private citizens,” Melania reminds me. Just two private citizens getting hitched at the groom’s 126-room Florida palace. He in a tux; she in a $100,000 Dior dress that laborers’ hands had toiled upon for a legendary 550 hours, affixing 1,500 crystals&#8212;jewels fit for private citizens like them. A pair of ordinary people, really, uniting in matrimony in the presence of Rudy Giuliani and Kelly Ripa, as Billy Joel serenaded the couple and guests slurped caviar and Cristal in the shadow of a five-foot-tall Grand Marnier wedding cake.\n<p>Those were, in some ways, simpler times. But things change quickly&#8212;which is perhaps the enduring fact of Melania Trump’s entire improbable life&#8212;and when your husband works up a plan to make America great again, the very same Clintons you once smiled with on your wedding day can now become your family’s mortal enemies. And you can think, as Melania Trump says she does, that it’s no huge deal, really. “This is it, what it is,” Melania tells me. “It’s all business now; it’s nothing personal.”</p>\n<p>Of course, Melania had the foresight to imagine that politics would bring chaos. Donald’s first wife, Ivana, may have wanted Trump to be president, but Melania, his third, was never hot on the idea. “When we discussed about it, I said he really needs to make sure he knows he really wants to do it, because life changes,” Melania says.</p>\n<p>We’re speaking on the phone, though I have no idea where she’s calling from. Is she in her penthouse, a gilded triplex in the Trump Tower? Perhaps somewhere out on the campaign trail? While she’s a crowd-pleaser on the stump, she appears infrequently and only when she deigns to. “Nobody controls me. I travel with my husband when I can,” she says, “when I know that I can go, and I know that my son is okay alone for a few days with the help.”</p>\n<p>While Donald often says that Melania would make a stellar First Lady, the former model offers little clue about what a move to the White House would mean for her. She once said she would be “traditional,” like Jackie Kennedy, and on the question of what causes she might support, she has noted she is already involved in “many, many charities.” She elaborated: “Many different charities involving children, involving many different diseases.”</p>\n<p>In this respect, she is just like her husband. She’s alluringly opaque. She makes meaningful eye contact and emphatically repeats affirmative, folksy banalities&#8212;she “has a thick skin,” she takes things “day by day,” she follows the news “from A to Z”&#8212;until the interviewer either is transported into a supra-verbal understanding or decides it’s pointless to press for specifics. But unlike her husband, Melania is reserved, polite, and steady, say those close to her. “There is a peace in her,” one old friend from Slovenia tells me. She is a homebody. She’s rich, but not a socialite; she prefers family to the It set and retires early after events.</p>\n<p>This image of a retiring homebody, of course, is not the one that Trump’s enemies present when they conjure her in the White House. Ahead of Utah’s primary, allies of Ted Cruz posted a photo from a shoot for a 2000 issue of British <em>GQ</em> in which a naked Melania is lying on her stomach on a white bearskin rug. “Meet Melania Trump. Your next First Lady,” read the ad, aimed at conservative Mormon voters. “Or, you could support Ted Cruz on Tuesday.”</p>\n<p>Trump shot back in a cryptic, menacing message that he would “spill the beans” on Heidi Cruz and then re-tweeted two photos, side by side: one, a mid-sentence Heidi, looking like a gargoyle; another, a bronzed, blue-eyed Melania, looking like a fox. “The images are worth a thousand words,” the caption read, though Trump’s tweet itself was really communicating only four: “My wife is hotter.”</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Those who know Melania say the Jackie template isn’t a bad one for her to aspire to. “She’d be great at picking out the china patterns; she’d be a classic First Lady,” says stylist Phillip Bloch, who has worked with both of the Trumps and attended fashion shows with Melania. But unlike Jackie, who met John Kennedy when he was already a congressman, Melania wasn’t signing on to be a political spouse when she met the notorious Donald Trump in 1998.</p>\n<p>Melania had signed up for a life of conspicuous conspicuousness, one she dutifully chronicled on Instagram and Twitter up until about a year ago, when her social-media accounts&#8212;unlike those of her husband&#8212;went silent with Trump’s entrance into the race. There was Melania in a white robe, working with her “glam team” of stylists, perched on a gilded throne, overlooking Central Park. Here she was, head to toe in white, posing on the Trump jet. There she was, relaxing at “#home #NYC” on a Thursday night, in a room that looked like a fevered baroque dream. In one of her last posts&#8212;right before somebody deemed it advisable to slam shut this opulent little window on her life&#8212;she snapped a parting selfie in a gold-mirrored bathroom. “Bye! I’m off to my #summer residence.”</p>\n<p>While Melania enjoys the services of a chef and an assistant, there’s no nanny raising their son, Barron. That’s the mother’s duty. “We know our roles,” Melania once told Parenting.com, referring to the division of labor with her husband. “I didn’t want him to change the diapers or put Barron to bed.” The boy she calls “little Donald” wants one day to be a “businessman and golfer” and, as she told the publication, almost always dresses in suits. “He’s not a sweatpants child,” she’s said.</p>\n<p>Melania is as fastidious a wife as she is a mother, which Donald appreciates. Things come easy with her. “I work very hard from early in the morning till late in the evening,” Donald told Larry King in 2005. “I don’t want to go home and work at a relationship.” To the twice-divorced Donald, Melania is terrific. He’s never heard her fart or make doodie, as he once told Howard Stern. (Melania has said the key to the success of her marriage is separate bathrooms.) He can trust her to take her birth control every day, he boasted to Stern; she’s just amazing that way. She has the perfect proportions&#8212;five feet eleven, 125 pounds&#8212;and great boobs, which is no trivial matter. Stern once asked Trump what he would do if Melania were in a terrible car accident, God forbid, and lost the use of her left arm, developed an oozing red splotch near her eye, and mangled her left foot. Would Donald stay with her?</p>\n<p>“How do the breasts look?” Trump asked.</p>\n<p>“The breasts are okay,” Stern replied. Then, yeah, of course Trump stays. “Because that’s important.” There are other pluses. He appreciates Melania’s restraint when it comes to Shopping While Trump. “She’s never taken advantage of that situation, okay, as many women would have, frankly,” he has said. (“I prefer quality over quantity,” Melania tells me.) Donald does his part to make things work, too. “He is a very understanding husband,” Melania once told an interviewer. “If I say, ‘I need an hour, I’m going to take a bath,’ or I’m having a massage, he doesn’t have nothing against it. He’s very supportive in that way.” She lets him have his space; she’s not “needy” or “nagging,” as she tells me.</p>\n<p>As for passions beyond the familial, there are a few. Melania dabbles in design. Her line of affordable gem-spangled jewelry and watches, launched on QVC, reportedly sold out in 45 minutes during its initial broadcast. (Melania’s caviar-infused anti-aging creams haven’t sold as well, though a federal judge ruled in her favor in a lawsuit she filed against its promoters.)</p>\n<p>When she was getting her jewelry plans off the ground, Melania sketched the designs for the collection herself, relying on a talent for drawing that her childhood friends tell me she flashed as a girl. “It’s not free; it’s precise,” Petra Sedej, one of Melania’s high school classmates, says of her art. “She has a really good feeling for this.” Another old friend whom I met in Slovenia, and who asked not to be named, sums up Melania’s talents more generally: “People say she’s smart, she’s well-educated like Jackie Kennedy, but…” The friend pauses to find the right words. “She’s smart for the things she’s interested in, like jewelry. She’s not stupid, she’s not a bimbo, but she’s not especially clever.”</p>\n<p>To Melania’s traditional way of thinking, Trump’s aspirations for the White House have little to do with her. The same can be said for his more controversial positions, like his general disdain for immigrants, even though his wife became an American only in 2006. “I chose not to go into politics and policy,” she tells me. “Those policies are my husband’s job.” She has opinions, she assures me, and shares them with Trump. “Nobody knows and nobody will ever know,” she says of the advice she provides him. “Because that’s between me and my husband.”</p>\n<p>The approach is in keeping with her view of her wifely functions. “She stays in her lane,” Bloch says. “When asked, she gives her opinion, but otherwise she stays out of it.”</p>\n<p>Vladimira Tomšič, who went to the same school as Melania and is friendly with her parents, tells me that her upbringing helps explain her marriage. “The secret of why he’s with her,” she explains, “is her traditional values and the importance of family to her.” In other words, that bearskin-rug photo is a red herring: Melania is the ideal wife for the conservative base. She is, in fact, positively biblical&#8212;Trump’s perfect “help meet,” his “suitable helper,” as the Bible’s description of Eve would have it. Melania Trump is as tailored to The Donald as if a divine plastic surgeon had sculpted her out of his rib.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Years earlier, while modeling in Milan and Paris, Melania had Germanized her last name from <em>Knavs,</em> changing the <em>v</em> to a <em>u</em> and adding an extra <em>s.</em> She had done very well in Europe, but not supermodel well, and hoped to advance her career in the U.S. Paolo Zampolli, a wealthy Italian whose business interests in New York are broad and vague, brought Melania over on a modeling contract and a work visa. Sometimes, in order to promote his models, he would send a few girls to an event and invite photographers, producers, and rich playboys. That night in September 1998, Zampolli had invited Trump, who arrived with a date but was immediately taken with Melania. He sent his companion to the bathroom so he could have a few minutes to chat up the model he’d noticed. But Melania knew of Trump’s reputation&#8212;which was immediately confirmed by the fact that he had come to the party with a date and was now asking for her number.</p>\n<p>She refused, and instead asked Trump for <em>his</em> contact information. Unimpressed with merely catching the eye of the famous billionaire, Melania was studying the situation as if testing a coin with her teeth. “If I give him my number, I’m just one of the women he calls,” she remembers. Melania was curious to see if he’d proffer a business number. “I wanted to see what his intention is,” she explains. “It tells you a lot from the man what kind of number he gives you. He gave me all of his numbers.”</p>\n<p>Perhaps Trump saw something worth admiring in Melania’s willingness to walk away from the deal. Indeed, she waited a week before calling him. “I’m not starstruck,” she explains. “We had a great connection, we had great chemistry, but I was not starstruck. And maybe he noticed that.”</p>\n<p>Soon after Melania and Donald started dating, she apparently broke it off. “She had some trust issues with him at the beginning,” says Matthew Atanian, a photographer who had been Melania’s roommate at Zeckendorf Towers in Union Square when she first moved to New York. “She was telling me that she wouldn’t have it, he was back to his old ways. She kept her apartment to have her own space because of this.”</p>\n<p>Within six months, Atanian says, they were back together. Either she set Donald straight&#8212;he has insisted that his fidelity to Melania is absolute&#8212;or she made her peace with the immutable character of The Donald, telling every interviewer who asks that she doesn’t seek to change him. What she has found in Trump&#8212;despite the age difference and behavior that would make most women run&#8212;is apparently what she was always looking for. “It’s about all that power and protection,” one of Melania’s old friends from Ljubljana tells me. “I think she needed a strong man, a father figure.”</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Sevnica, the small railroad town where she was born Melanija Knavs in 1970, is about an hour’s drive from the Slovenian capital. In contrast to the privations that so many suffered in Communist times, the Knavses lived well. Melania’s mother, Amalija Ulčnik, worked developing patterns at a factory that manufactured children’s clothing. She had met Viktor Knavs in 1966 while he was the chauffeur for a nearby town’s mayor.</p>\n<p>Even in those days, when Slovenia was part of Communist Yugoslavia and times were lean, Amalija was always impeccably dressed and perfectly coiffed. “She was very pretty,” says Tomšič, who now runs a local hospital to which Melania donated $25,000 after marrying Donald. “She was always very fancy.” Amalija spent evenings after work sewing clothing for herself and her two daughters, Ines and Melania. Once she learned to draw, Melania sketched her own designs, and her mother or sister sewed them. Melania also made her own jewelry. “Melania never wore anything from the store,” recalls one friend.</p>\n<p>The family struck a worldly image, too, vacationing in France, Italy, and Germany. Every room of their apartment in Sevnica was painted a deep, lush color&#8212;blue in the living room, red in the kitchen, yellow in Melania’s room. Amalija, who got to travel to France and Germany for work, returned with colorful paints for the home, a rarity in Yugoslavia. She also came back from business trips with Western fashion magazines, which Melania’s friends watched her flip through constantly. “They had more than the others,” remembers Melania’s childhood friend Mirjana Jelančič. (She is now the principal of the school she attended with Melania, where there is talk of installing a permanent exhibit on Mrs. Trump, the school’s most famous graduate.)</p>\n<p>Jelančič remembers Melania’s father, Viktor, spending every Saturday lovingly washing his antique Mercedes, another rarity. “It was like a ritual,” Jelančič tells me. After leaving his job working for the mayor of Hrastnik, Viktor, then a member of the Slovenian Communist Party, became a salesman at a state-owned car company. Police files from the time indicate Viktor aroused suspicion for illicit trade and tax evasion in 1976. (He was charged with a tax offense, though his record was later cleared on account of Slovenia’s statute of limitations, a process the courts described to me as “legal rehabilitations.”) Melania blocked my efforts to speak to Viktor, and she denies that any such investigation took place. “He was never under any investigation, he was never in trouble,” she snaps. “We have a clean past. I don’t have nothing to hide.”</p>\n<p>While working for the car company in Ljubljana, Viktor had an apartment there, in one of the city’s first residential high-rises. It was a prestigious address and provided the girls a place to stay in the capital so that they could attend design school&#8212;another luxury. Meanwhile, in Sevnica, a place where most people still lived in drab apartments doled out to them by their factories, Viktor managed to build a house situated in what was considered the toniest part of town.</p>\n<p>“Trump reminds me of Viktor,” Viktor’s friend and neighbor Tomaž Jeraj tells me. “He’s a salesman. He has business in his veins.” It’s a sentiment unanimous in Sevnica, where Viktor and Amalija still own their house and visit two or three times a year.</p>\n<p>Indeed, if you look at photos of Viktor Knavs and Donald Trump side by side, you wouldn’t be surprised at the comparison. Donald is just five years younger than his father-in-law. Both are tall, portly men with blond hair and sharp suits; they’re brash men who like the finer things in life. “He likes quality,” says Melania. “Viki”&#8212;as Viktor is known to his friends here&#8212;“likes good food,” Jeraj tells me. “He loves cars.” He was one of the many people who would tell me about Viktor’s extensive collection of Mercedes. “You’ll never see him in another car.”</p>\n<p>Those who know the Knavses say that Viktor is boisterous and strong-willed. “Jokes come naturally to him,” Ana Jelančič, a neighbor and friend of the Knavses’, tells me. “If he goes into a bar, people pay attention.” Viktor sucks the air out of a room, she says. “He is the strong one in the relationship. Amalija supports him. She is a wonderful mother and wife.”</p>\n<p>Plenty of acquaintances hold the Knavses in high esteem. “They are the typical Slovenian family,” says Tomšič, the hospital director. “They are traditional, their family ties are very strong.” And friends of Viktor’s speak admiringly of his reputed business acumen. Another friend of Viktor’s tells me, “He’s a salesman. He follows the market.”</p>\n<p>Far from objecting to the comparison that’s made between her husband and her father, Melania agrees they’re a lot alike. “They’re both hardworking,” she says. “They’re both very smart and very capable. They grew up in totally different environments, but they have the same values, they have the same tradition. I myself am similar to my husband. Do you understand what I mean? So is my dad; he is a family man, he has tradition, he was hardworking. So is my husband.”</p>\n<p>Like Donald Trump, Viktor Knavs is not just a hard-charging businessman with a penchant for real estate; he is also viciously litigious when it comes to the women in his life. Back when Viktor was a driver, before he married Melania’s mother, he met a young woman in town named Marija Cigelnjak. They dated for a while, and in September 1964, she told Viktor she was pregnant. According to Cigelnjak’s testimony in a lengthy court record, Viktor offered to marry her, but quickly changed his mind, demanding that she have an abortion. This, Viktor said, was because the child was not his. A son was born in May 1965, and three months later, Marija sued Viktor for child support. Viktor continued to deny paternity&#8212;going into detail for the court about when he had sex with Marija and the rhythms of her menstrual cycle&#8212;prompting the court to order a blood test. Based on its results, the court determined that Viktor was, in fact, the boy’s biological father. Viktor fought the order to pay child support all the way to Slovenia’s highest appellate court. The courts always ruled in Cigelnjak’s favor. (The court record indicates that Viktor filed his appeal late&#8212;and lied brazenly and unconvincingly about the nature of the delay.)</p>\n<p>Viktor has never acknowledged his son, Denis Cigelnjak, who is now 50. The existence of Melania’s half brother has never been reported, and although he had never spoken to the media, he told me his story and then gave me permission to retrieve the relevant court documents from the Slovenian archives.</p>\n<p>He lives in a tiny apartment in Hrastnik, the town where his mother, who passed away several years ago, once worked at the glass factory. She never married or had more children, and Denis says he has no memory of ever meeting his father. Viktor paid child support until the boy was 18 but never reached out. “I missed being able to say, ‘Hey, Dad, let’s go for a coffee,’ ” Denis told me as we sat in his living room this spring. Periodically, Denis would hear stories about his father, but he said he was afraid to initiate contact and disturb the Knavs family. Now he feels it’s too late. He didn’t seek attention and says he wants nothing from his father or the Trumps. He wouldn’t mind meeting his half sisters, Ines and Melania, who, he’s fairly certain, don’t even know he exists. (When I asked Melania about this over the phone, she denied that it was true. Later, after I’d sent her documents from the Slovenian court, she wrote to me claiming she hadn’t understood what I’d asked, explaining, “I’ve known about this for years.” She added: “My father is a private individual. Please respect his privacy.”)</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Stane Jerko, the photographer credited with spotting Melania and producing her first real photo shoot back in 1987, saw something similar. He had glimpsed her waiting for her friend after a fashion show in Ljubljana. She was lanky and shy, with long hair and sparkling eyes. Jerko, who preferred to find his models in public places rather than through casting calls, had suggested she come by his studio. She wasn’t interested, he recalls. “School was the most important thing for her.” But a week later, she arrived, hair in a teenybopper ponytail, with a bushel of her own clothes: leggings, leotards, high-waisted acid-washed jeans, and a sleeveless sweater that looked like a wicker basket. She was reserved and tense but followed Jerko’s instructions and quickly figured out how to pose. He could see she had a future in front of the camera. A couple of weeks later, she returned, and Jerko snapped a series of black-and-white photos of a 16-year-old Melanija Knavs in some catalog clothes, barefoot in each image. It wasn’t a stylistic choice. “I didn’t have shoes for her because she had very big feet,” Jerko says of Melania, who wore the equivalent of a size 9 shoe. “The other models had smaller feet.” (You know what they say in Slovenia about people with big feet? Jerko asks, chuckling. “When you live on big feet, you live big.”)</p>\n<p>In those days, Melania wasn’t thinking about a career as a model. Like her sister, Ines, her goal was to become a designer, and she applied to the school of architecture at the local university, successfully passing the notoriously difficult entrance exams. In those years in Ljubljana, she was focused on school. She didn’t drink, didn’t party, didn’t smoke. Even after she met Jerko and began dabbling in modeling, she preferred to go home after work, to be with her equally quiet and reserved sister. “She kept to herself, she was a loner. After a shoot or a catwalk, she went home, not out. She didn’t want to waste time partying,” Jerko remembers.</p>\n<p>“Boys at that time liked more party girls, and we were not this,” Petra Sedej, Melania’s classmate in those days, tells me. Instead, they would gather in Melania’s or Petra’s apartment, “drink juice and talk.” Another old friend from Ljubljana recalls that Melania “was a bit special that way. She was really happy with those two, three, four people she was with. She didn’t need more.”</p>\n<p>Those who remember Melania also say she seemed somehow on a plane above her peers, her gaze always focused on a point above and beyond them. At an age when her classmates were pimply, casual high schoolers, Melania was always perfectly made up, recalls Sedej. Foundation, mascara, blush, lip gloss, all in just the right, subtle amount. “Even in summertime,” she says, “she was always perfect, every day.” In college, Melania dated a fellow model, a sought-after guy studying physical education. But she was unsatisfied with his lack of seriousness. He was a good-looking, sporty 20-year-old; she was a beautiful young woman who wanted something more than a hummingbird college romance. That this boy couldn’t provide what she sought disappointed Melania, Sedej says. “She was very sensitive. She wanted more.” Recalls another friend from those days, “We were all 20, but she was much more mature.”</p>\n<p>By 1992&#8212;the year Melania won second place in a Slovenian Look of the Year modeling contest&#8212;she seemed to have outgrown not just Ljubljana but all of newly independent Slovenia. The large media market of Yugoslavia&#8212;with some 24 million people&#8212;had been chopped up. Staying in her tiny new country of 2 million would mean the end of her modeling career. To have a shot at something bigger, at a real future in modeling, she had to move. “She was sure that there was nothing for her in Slovenia,” says the friend from Ljubljana. “She wanted to leave.”</p>\n<p>Melania decamped to Milan after her first year of college, effectively dropping out. Her connections to home grew faint. Sedej saw her for the occasional coffee on the rare occasions she visited Ljubljana, but has lost track of her since. She and her classmates wrote to Melania about their 20th high school reunion a few years ago. They e-mailed Melania’s representatives, they wrote to her on Facebook. There was no response. “She cut the line behind her,” says the friend from Ljubljana. “She started to live another life, and all this is behind her.”</p>\n<p>Melania thrived in Milan and Paris, and in 1996, having fallen in with Zampolli, the agent who brokered her visa and American modeling contract, she moved to New York with visions of truly making it big. But Melania, still only 26, would confront the perils of growing older as a model. “It was a frustrating age for models, the late 20s. It’s not a friendly industry to models of that age,” says Atanian, the former roommate. Zampolli’s agency paid Melania’s share of the rent as part of their contract. “She aired frustration over the work issue,” Atanian recalls. She wondered often why this or that photographer picked someone else over her, often someone younger. “She wasn’t working every day,” he added. “She was going to castings every day and not succeeding every day. She said things were very different in Europe, that she had been more successful.” Melania was having a hard time supporting herself, worried that her best years were behind her. (“Pictures tell for itself,” Melania says firmly when I ask her about Atanian’s characterization of this supposed tough patch. “My portfolio says what I did,” including “the best catalogs.”)</p>\n<p>In an increasingly unfriendly market, Melania looked for advantages. She went on casting calls for alcohol and tobacco ads, which her under-age competitors couldn’t be hired for. Once, she landed a Camel ad, a billboard in Times Square. She sought an edge in other ways. “She went away for a two-week vacation, then came back, and was more…buxom,” Atanian says, groping for the right but least offensive word. “She admitted it to me. She just said it needed to be done to get more lingerie jobs.”</p>\n<p>Again, Melania scoffs when I ask if she had had a breast augmentation. “I didn’t make any changes,” she says. “A lot of people say I am using all the procedures for my face. I didn’t do anything. I live a healthy life, I take care of my skin and my body. I’m against Botox, I’m against injections; I think it’s damaging your face, damaging your nerves. It’s all me. I will age gracefully, as my mom does.”</p>\n<p>In New York, Melania lived a quiet, homebound life, taking assiduous care of her body: walks with ankle weights, seven pieces of fruit every day, diligently moisturizing her skin. She rarely partied, never brought anyone back to the apartment, and was always home early. “She didn’t go out to dance clubs; she’d go to Cipriani for dinner at ten and be home by one,” Atanian recalls. “Men she would go out with tended to be wealthier, the industrious, European type. They were Italians, playboys. But they’d go out for dinner and she’d be home before I was.”</p>\n<p>It was Zampolli, again, who rescued her in 1998&#8212;with that invitation to the party at the Kit Kat Club, unwittingly putting her on a charmed trajectory toward a certain playboy’s phone number and, who knows, maybe even the White House.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Obediently, she teetered out onto the stage on vertiginous Louboutins, a long-legged doll in a summery dress the color of sea foam. She was unseasonably tan, clearly comfortable in this role: being admired as a specimen of physical beauty. She began by reading from the remarks waiting for her at the podium, a list she’d compiled of her husband’s attributes. “He’s a hard worker. He’s kind. He has a great heart. He’s tough. He’s smart. He’s a great communicator. He’s a great negotiator. He’s telling the truth. He’s a great leader. He’s fair.”</p>\n<p>The speech&#8212;all short, declarative sentences&#8212;sounded like it had been written by her son as a homework assignment but quickly got to what sounded like recess talk. “As you may know by now, when you attack him, he will punch back ten times harder,” she said loudly, firmly, and to wild applause. “No matter who you are, a man or a woman. He treats everyone equal.”</p>\n<p>To Melania’s right, the presidential aspirant, the equal-opportunity puncher, nodded approvingly. Maybe Melania hadn’t wanted any of this a year ago&#8212;hadn’t wanted her husband to run, hadn’t wanted all the prying scrutiny, hadn’t wanted to become a politician’s wife. But here she was, taking the strangeness of life in her long, tan stride. She smiled, tautly, like a sphinx and beheld the throng before her. She was proud of her husband. He had a great heart.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><em><strong>Julia Ioffe</strong> is a contributing writer for <em>The New York Times Magazine</em>.

One of the Greatest? you ask, your thumb emoticon poised to turn up or down on me. The guy haters love to hate with their very best hate game? Like 20-Dollar Bill great? Like Mount Rushmore great?\n<p>Yep. (We just won’t build Mount Rushmores anymore.) In so many ways, Obama was better than we imagined, better than the body politic deserved, and far, far better than his enemies will ever concede, but the great thing about being great is that the verdict of enemies doesn’t matter.</p>\n<p>In fact, and I say this as a Bill Clinton fan, I now feel certain that, in the coming decades, Obama’s star will rise higher than Clinton’s, and he’ll replace Bill in the public mind as the Greatest Democrat since FDR.</p>\n<p>This has to do with the nature of Obama’s leadership, which is to play to legacy (and Clinton’s impulse, which is to play to the room). Bill Clinton will long be revered because he’s charismatic, presided over an economic revival, and changed and elevated the view of the Democratic Party. Barack Obama will long be revered because he’s charismatic, presided over an economic revival, and changed and elevated the view of the <em>presidency.</em> He’s simply bigger than Bill.</p>\n<p>More to the point, Obama’s legacy is the sort that gets canonized. Because the first rule of Hall of Fame-dom: The times have to suck for the president not to. Civil wars, World Wars, depressions and recessions. You got to have ’em if you wanna be great. That’s why we rate the Washingtons, Lincolns, and Roosevelts over That Fat Guy with the Walrus Mustache. Like Obama, these Great Men were dealt sucky hands, won big, and left the country better off than it was before.</p>\n<p>But it’s also why we downgrade the Jimmy Carters and Herbert Hoovers. Were they as bad in real time as we remember them in history? Probably not. But they were dealt sucky hands, only played one round, and left the country feeling worse off. Legacy Game over. (Hoover reminds me more and more of Donald Trump! Elected with little political experience, Hoover was a rich bastard whose central theme was that government was wasteful. His answer to the Great Depression was to start a trade war and build a massive project called the Hoover Dam. The dam turned out to be a giant wall that did not stop or solve larger problems. Déjà vu, thy name is Trump Wall!)</p>\n<p>Obama has a few other edges in the long haul of history, beyond specific hurrah moments like Obamacare, rescuing the economy, and making America <em>way</em> more bi-curious. Being the first black president of course secures a certain legacy. But what now feels distinctly possible is that, just as Martin Luther King Jr. dreamed, over time he may be judged less for the color of his skin than for the content of his character. That character came across every time haters or Trumpers or birthers tried to pull him down into the mud or question his American-ness. He just flew above it all. And, luckily, he <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/pete-souza-obamas-chief-white-house-photographer-interview\">took most of us with him</a>. He was the Leader not only of our country but of our mood and disposition, which is harder to rule. At a time when we became more polarized, our discourse pettier and more poisoned, Obama always came across as the Adult in the Room, the one we wanted to be and follow.</p>\n<p>Ironically, one of the lock-ins to his Hall of Fame Greatness was originally supposed to be his Achilles’ heel, the shallow thing critics loved to smear him with: his eloquence, his “reliance” on speeches and teleprompters (Sarah Palin once famously screeched, “Mr. President…step away from the teleprompter and do your job!” while herself <em>reading from a teleprompter</em>), as if addressing the country as a whole, trying to unify or inspire people, were a superficial thing. But pivotal words at pivotal moments are not only how we come to admire great leaders, it’s the primary way we remember them. The first thing most people can recall about Lincoln? The Gettysburg Address. FDR? Fireside chats. George Washington? His amazing Snapchats. (George was first with <em>everything.</em>)</p>\n<p>With Obama, each thoughtful step of the way, from his soaring acceptance speech (“The road ahead will be long. Our climb will be steep…”) to his epic speeches on race and religion, his responses to the shootings in Tucson and Newtown, the killing of Osama bin Laden, the opening of Cuba <em>(“Todos somos Americanos!”),</em> and countless other momentous occasions, he knew how to speak to our better angels at a time when it was hard to locate <em>any</em> angels.</p>\n<p>Lastly, there’s the arc of history, bound to bend downward. As our unity becomes more frayed, more tenuous, and the ability for any politician to get anything done more unlikely, the job of president will become less LBJ tactical and less FDR big-dealer. The job will largely be to <em>preside.</em> To unify where and however we can. In this way, too, <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/barack-obama-preparing-for-third-term\">Obama pointed the way forward</a>.</p>\n<p>It may be hard to imagine now, but in the face of rising chaos, we’ll crave unity all the more, and in future years whoever can speak most <em>convincingly</em> of unity will rise to the top. (It’s also hard to imagine many beating Obama at the game.) This year’s carnival election, with Trump as a kind of debauched circus barker, only makes the distinction clearer. The absurdity and car-crash spectacle of it all have already lent Obama an out-of-time quality, as if <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/obama-the-nerd\">he were a creature from another, loftier century</a>. Whatever happens next, I feel this in my bones: We’ll look back at history, hopefully when we’re zooming down the Barack Obama Hyperloop Transport System, and think: That man was rare. And we were damn lucky to have him.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h5>WATCH NOW: Thanks Obama: Tom Ford, Chance the Rapper, Samantha Bee and Other Celebrities Send Off the Preside</h5>","channel":"News & Culture","subChannel":"Politics","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"identifiable":true,"hierarchical":false},"revisionAuthor":"Stephen Aguila","issueDate":"","hed":"Why Obama Will Go Down as One of the Greatest Presidents of All Time","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[{"fields":{"name":"Culture","slug":"culture","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"59b038ed0a8d2f0976474f19","revision":0,"createdAt":"2017-09-06T18:05:33.571Z","modifiedAt":"2017-09-06T18:05:33.571Z","revisionCreatedAt":"2017-09-06T18:05:33.571Z","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"categories-colors":[],"contributorsPhotographer":[],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"revisionCreatedAt":"2016-02-23T18:41:10.829Z","meta":{"collectionName":"contributors","modelName":"contributor","publishable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"identifiable":true,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":false},"revisionAuthor":"Stephen Aguila","bio":"","name":"Jim Nelson","socialMedia":[],"id":"5582cf211177d66d68d59831","createdAt":"2015-06-18T14:01:05.489Z","revision":4,"modifiedAt":"2016-02-23T18:41:10.829Z","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors"}}],"publishHistory":{"searchable":true,"expired":false,"revisionAuthor":"CopilotUpdateTool","pubDate":"2016-04-14T16:01:00.000Z","uri":"story/obama-greatest-president-legacy","template":"full-bleed","createdAt":"2017-10-21T00:37:26.029Z","revision":45,"entityId":"570bd4b79fcd51692b478dd2"},"categories-franchises":[],"categories-shows-movies-documentaries":[],"categories-events":[],"categories-formats":[],"categories-holidays":[],"categories-famous-people":[{"fields":{"name":"Barack Obama","slug":"barack-obama","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"59b038eb7246eb56980ac792","revision":0,"createdAt":"2017-09-06T18:05:31.925Z","modifiedAt":"2017-09-06T18:05:31.925Z","revisionCreatedAt":"2017-09-06T18:05:31.925Z","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"videosLede":[],"categories-styles":[],"categories-topics":[{"fields":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"59b038ecf667492236d9173f","revision":0,"createdAt":"2017-09-06T18:05:32.458Z","modifiedAt":"2017-09-06T18:05:32.458Z","revisionCreatedAt":"2017-09-06T18:05:32.458Z","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"categories-products":[],"categories-destinations":[],"categories-materials":[],"photosTout":[{"fields":{"aspectRatios":{"3:2":{"width":1998,"height":1332,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":1,"y":0,"width":1998,"height":1332}}},"3:4":{"width":999,"height":1333,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":500,"y":0,"height":1333,"width":999}}},"64:25":{"width":1984,"height":775,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":0,"y":106,"height":775,"width":1984}}},"16:9":{"width":2000,"height":1125,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":0,"y":0,"width":2000,"height":1125}}},"4:3":{"width":1776,"height":1332,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":111,"y":0,"height":1332,"width":1776}}},"1:1":{"width":1333,"height":1333,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":333,"y":0,"width":1333,"height":1333}}},"master":{"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/gq/production/2016/04/13/570ea3c86069583e3cf8c5de_Obama-Editor-Letter-may-2016.jpg","width":2000,"height":1333}},"revisionCreatedAt":"2016-04-13T19:55:07.529Z","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","publishable":false,"image":true,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"identifiable":false,"hierarchical":false},"revisionAuthor":"Shakeil Greeley","filename":"Obama-Editor-Letter-may-2016.jpg","title":"Obama-Editor-Letter-may-2016.jpg","credit":"Illustration by GQ;

One of the Greatest? you ask, your thumb emoticon poised to turn up or down on me. The guy haters love to hate with their very best hate game? Like 20-Dollar Bill great? Like Mount Rushmore great?\n<p>Yep. (We just won’t build Mount Rushmores anymore.) In so many ways, Obama was better than we imagined, better than the body politic deserved, and far, far better than his enemies will ever concede, but the great thing about being great is that the verdict of enemies doesn’t matter.</p>\n<p>In fact, and I say this as a Bill Clinton fan, I now feel certain that, in the coming decades, Obama’s star will rise higher than Clinton’s, and he’ll replace Bill in the public mind as the Greatest Democrat since FDR.</p>\n<p>This has to do with the nature of Obama’s leadership, which is to play to legacy (and Clinton’s impulse, which is to play to the room). Bill Clinton will long be revered because he’s charismatic, presided over an economic revival, and changed and elevated the view of the Democratic Party. Barack Obama will long be revered because he’s charismatic, presided over an economic revival, and changed and elevated the view of the <em>presidency.</em> He’s simply bigger than Bill.</p>\n<p>More to the point, Obama’s legacy is the sort that gets canonized. Because the first rule of Hall of Fame-dom: The times have to suck for the president not to. Civil wars, World Wars, depressions and recessions. You got to have ’em if you wanna be great. That’s why we rate the Washingtons, Lincolns, and Roosevelts over That Fat Guy with the Walrus Mustache. Like Obama, these Great Men were dealt sucky hands, won big, and left the country better off than it was before.</p>\n<p>But it’s also why we downgrade the Jimmy Carters and Herbert Hoovers. Were they as bad in real time as we remember them in history? Probably not. But they were dealt sucky hands, only played one round, and left the country feeling worse off. Legacy Game over. (Hoover reminds me more and more of Donald Trump! Elected with little political experience, Hoover was a rich bastard whose central theme was that government was wasteful. His answer to the Great Depression was to start a trade war and build a massive project called the Hoover Dam. The dam turned out to be a giant wall that did not stop or solve larger problems. Déjà vu, thy name is Trump Wall!)</p>\n<p>Obama has a few other edges in the long haul of history, beyond specific hurrah moments like Obamacare, rescuing the economy, and making America <em>way</em> more bi-curious. Being the first black president of course secures a certain legacy. But what now feels distinctly possible is that, just as Martin Luther King Jr. dreamed, over time he may be judged less for the color of his skin than for the content of his character. That character came across every time haters or Trumpers or birthers tried to pull him down into the mud or question his American-ness. He just flew above it all. And, luckily, he <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/pete-souza-obamas-chief-white-house-photographer-interview\">took most of us with him</a>. He was the Leader not only of our country but of our mood and disposition, which is harder to rule. At a time when we became more polarized, our discourse pettier and more poisoned, Obama always came across as the Adult in the Room, the one we wanted to be and follow.</p>\n<p>Ironically, one of the lock-ins to his Hall of Fame Greatness was originally supposed to be his Achilles’ heel, the shallow thing critics loved to smear him with: his eloquence, his “reliance” on speeches and teleprompters (Sarah Palin once famously screeched, “Mr. President…step away from the teleprompter and do your job!” while herself <em>reading from a teleprompter</em>), as if addressing the country as a whole, trying to unify or inspire people, were a superficial thing. But pivotal words at pivotal moments are not only how we come to admire great leaders, it’s the primary way we remember them. The first thing most people can recall about Lincoln? The Gettysburg Address. FDR? Fireside chats. George Washington? His amazing Snapchats. (George was first with <em>everything.</em>)</p>\n<p>With Obama, each thoughtful step of the way, from his soaring acceptance speech (“The road ahead will be long. Our climb will be steep…”) to his epic speeches on race and religion, his responses to the shootings in Tucson and Newtown, the killing of Osama bin Laden, the opening of Cuba <em>(“Todos somos Americanos!”),</em> and countless other momentous occasions, he knew how to speak to our better angels at a time when it was hard to locate <em>any</em> angels.</p>\n<p>Lastly, there’s the arc of history, bound to bend downward. As our unity becomes more frayed, more tenuous, and the ability for any politician to get anything done more unlikely, the job of president will become less LBJ tactical and less FDR big-dealer. The job will largely be to <em>preside.</em> To unify where and however we can. In this way, too, <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/barack-obama-preparing-for-third-term\">Obama pointed the way forward</a>.</p>\n<p>It may be hard to imagine now, but in the face of rising chaos, we’ll crave unity all the more, and in future years whoever can speak most <em>convincingly</em> of unity will rise to the top. (It’s also hard to imagine many beating Obama at the game.) This year’s carnival election, with Trump as a kind of debauched circus barker, only makes the distinction clearer. The absurdity and car-crash spectacle of it all have already lent Obama an out-of-time quality, as if <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/obama-the-nerd\">he were a creature from another, loftier century</a>. Whatever happens next, I feel this in my bones: We’ll look back at history, hopefully when we’re zooming down the Barack Obama Hyperloop Transport System, and think: That man was rare.

As I enter his office and take a seat at the opposite side of his desk&#8212;I don&#39;t offer a handshake, nor does he&#8212;he immediately hands me a sheet of paper. “Okay, that&#39;s for you,” he says warmly. “Nice poll. Just came out.” Between us, lined up along the front of his desk, are stacks of all of the recent magazines with his face on the cover&#8212;<em>Rolling Stone, Time, People, Newsweek, New York,</em> multiple copies of each, as though as an additional sideline he has opened the world&#39;s most narrowly focused newsstand.\n<p>As I settle in, his 27-year-old communications director, Hope Hicks, informs him that an article they have been expecting for a while about his time in military school has just been published.</p>\n<p>“Good or bad?” he asks.</p>\n<p>“Great,” she says.</p>\n<p>“ ‘Good athlete,’ all that stuff?” he checks.</p>\n<p>“ ‘Best athlete’…‘ladies’ man&#39;…,” she says.</p>\n<p>“Really?” he says, clearly pleased.</p>\n<p>“…‘best student’…,” she continues.</p>\n<p>“Yeah, I was a great student,” he says in a meditative tone. “I was good at everything.”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, that&#39;s what they said,” she confirms.</p>\n<p>He asks her to give a copy to me. (As it happens, I&#39;ve already read it online this morning; Ms. Hicks&#39;s summary is accurate.) “That&#39;s nice, huh?” he muses, and tells her he needs to write to his old classmates. “I heard they have some really nice quotes, and I haven&#39;t seen them in a long time.” He turns to me. “We get older, Chris, right? That&#39;s the bad part.”</p>\n<p>I entered the room using a cane, and he now asks, quite kindly and gently, a few questions about my problematic ankle. I tell him that it&#39;s pretty much fine now, though not what it once was.</p>\n<p>“Well, hey, what is?” he says. “Anyway, go ahead.”</p>\n<p>The conversation that follows&#8212;he makes clear at several points&#8212;isn&#39;t always to Trump&#39;s liking. At times I think his affront may be tactical, a way to better control the situation, but just as often he seems genuinely perplexed and annoyed that someone like him, a nice guy who is trying to give his best to the American people and who is riding high in every early poll, who is giving up his Monday lunchtime to share his considerable charm, should be asked to explain himself like this. In these moments, I have to remind myself of the remarkable and extensive catalog of incendiary comments he has made, and positions he has taken, as he has blitzkrieged the ill-prepared and undefended barricades of the American political process.</p>\n<p>But I start by discussing a small personal peculiarity.</p>\n<p><strong>GQ: You don&#39;t shake hands, do you? (1)</strong><br>\n<strong>DONALD TRUMP:</strong> Oh yeah, no, I do shake hands. Well, I&#39;ve been saying, and it&#39;s been borne out…if you have a cold, you pass the cold along to other people, or a flu. But no, I shake hands very gladly politically. I don&#39;t think you could be a politician if you didn&#39;t shake hands. Can you imagine if I refused to shake anybody&#39;s hands? <em>[“No,” chimes in Ms. Hicks, who will be remaining here for our interview.]</em> No&#8212;bottom line, I shake hands.</p>\n<p><strong>But if you go the whole way, you&#39;re going to have to touch a lot of dirty hands between now and next November.</strong><br>\nI&#39;ve been doing it. <em>[Ms. Hicks: “He&#39;s been doing it. Thirty thousand people at a rally the other week&#8212;he shook a lot of hands.”]</em> I&#39;ve been shaking thousands and thousands of hands on a daily basis, actually.</p>\n<p><strong>Does it make you shiver a little bit inside?</strong><br>\nNo, it&#39;s part of what I have to do to make America great again.</p>\n<p><strong>Are you having fun?</strong><br>\nI&#39;m having a good time. Because of the success of it, perhaps. It makes it a lot easier than some people that are not doing well. But I&#39;ve <em>really</em> enjoyed it. I really have.</p>\n<p><strong>Many years ago you said, “The fun is in the getting, not the having,” and I guess some people wonder whether that&#39;s your attitude toward the presidency.</strong><br>\nNo, actually in this case I don&#39;t think there&#39;s fun involved. It will be constant work to turn the country around because we have 50 million people on welfare, we have tremendous poverty levels at record numbers. We have almost a hundred million people out of work, out of the workforce. (2)</p>\n<p><strong>Putting it in the most basic way, there&#39;s a lot of people who really like you, but there&#39;s a lot of people who are deeply skeptical of your motives. Some people think it&#39;s a campaign driven by egotism, aimless ambition, and arrogance.</strong><br>\n<em>[slightly indignant half laugh]</em> This doesn&#39;t sound like a nice question! Look, I just have one thing in mind, and that&#39;s doing a great job for the country. Everybody has their detractors. Some people say arrogance, or whatever they may say. I only have one thing in mind and that&#39;s doing a great job for the country.</p>\n<p><strong>Whenever you explain why you&#39;d be a very fine president, a lot of what you say seems to boil down to: <em>Look, just shut up and trust me&#8212;I&#39;d be really good at this. I know I would.</em></strong><br>\nWell, I have been issuing a lot of policy over the last two-week period. But there is a certain amount of truth to that. I mean, I&#39;ve had tremendous success, and I&#39;ve just done it. And a lot of my supporters agree with that.</p>\n<p><strong>You&#39;ve broken many of the rules of how candidates usually act....</strong><br>\nThat&#39;s true. That, I agree with you. They say there&#39;s never been anything like this.</p>\n<p><strong>For instance, in recent times you&#39;ve referred to other people as: a loser, a total loser, a massive loser, grotesque, a moron, an obvious moron, a spoiled brat, a totally incompetent jerk, a stiff, a dummy, a bimbo, a clown, a low-class slob, a perv sleazebag, a major sleaze and buffoon, a spoiled brat without a properly functioning brain, a goofball atheist, a dope, a dummy dope, a dopey clown, a dog, and so on.</strong><br>\nWell, other people have said a lot of things about things, too. They&#39;ve said plenty of bad stuff.</p>\n<p><strong>But you&#39;ve got a vocabulary and an approach that&#39;s different.</strong><br>\nProbably. Probably that&#39;s why people are here, that&#39;s why I have this, you know. <em>[He gestures to the stacks of magazines lying between us.]</em> Every magazine cover. And maybe we&#39;ll have another. Are we gonna be the cover story, do you know? Or not? We should be, we should be. Based on merit, we should be. But we&#39;ll see. Not sure I want it. You&#39;re going to ask a positive question before the interview&#39;s over, right?</p>\n<p><strong>Well, I think the positive comes from the answer. Anyway, will you still talk like that if you&#39;re president?</strong><br>\nNo. Probably not.</p>\n<p><strong>Why not?</strong><br>\nDepends. It depends. I think probably I&#39;d be much different. I have a great capacity to be what I have to be, and as president you may want a different tone. But that&#39;s a highly competitive tone, and many of those expressions&#8212;not all, but many of those expressions&#8212;are highly descriptive. It&#39;s hard to find words to compete with them when talking about somebody. But no, I would imagine I would be quite a bit different. I would feel differently about things as a president. Right now, I&#39;m fighting a lot of people. As a president I would be more measured.</p>\n<p><strong>But part of your appeal, and part of what you&#39;re selling as your appeal, is that you&#39;re different. And if people are going to vote for you, surely they want the real Donald Trump to be the president?</strong><br>\nYeah, I would be. I wouldn&#39;t change much, but I think I would probably tone down the rhetoric, perhaps. And perhaps not. Depends on who it was that I was speaking about. We have some bad dudes out there.</p>\n<p><strong>If anyone attacks you, you bite back pretty hard, don&#39;t you?</strong><br>\nYes. Yes.</p>\n<p><strong>If you were the same kind of president as you are a candidate, it sometimes feels like the first time some country disrespected you, you&#39;d just want to nuke them.</strong><br>\nNo, no, no. But some of these countries are really taking advantage of us and I would fight for fairness of our country.</p>\n<p><strong>But would you be scared to nuke them if you thought it was justified?</strong><br>\nI wouldn&#39;t be nuking anybody.</p>\n<p><strong>Under any circumstances?</strong><br>\nUnder… I will have a military that&#39;s so strong and powerful, and so respected, we&#39;re not gonna have to nuke anybody.</p>\n<p><strong>So could we get rid of the weapons?</strong><br>\nNo, no, we wouldn&#39;t get rid of the weapons. Because you have so many people out there. But I would be somebody that would be amazingly calm under pressure.</p>\n<p><strong>But if you&#39;re not going to use them, what&#39;s the point in having them?</strong><br>\nThe fact that other people have them. And unfortunately gaining more and more.</p>\n<p><strong>But ultimately you have to be prepared to press the button or there&#39;s no point in having them?</strong><br>\nWell, I don&#39;t want to talk about that subject because that&#39;s not a subject that, you know… <em>[restarts his thought]</em> that has to do with that whole… <em>[restarts his thought again]</em> I just don&#39;t want to talk about it. It is highly, highly, highly, highly unlikely that I would ever be using them.</p>\n<p><strong>As you know, people ask a lot of questions about your attitude toward women. When you were asked on <em>The View</em> what your message was to women and you said you wanted to cherish them, protect them,</strong> take care of them&#8212;<br>\nAnd respect them, yes. I do respect them, I have great respect for women. In fact, one of the reasons <em>The Apprentice</em> was such a successful show for so many years, the audience of women was fantastic.</p>\n<p><strong>Sure, but that&#39;s an entertainment TV show.</strong><br>\nNo, but it&#39;s indicative. I have great respect for women, and I will do more for women than anybody because I get things done and I know how to do things. And I&#39;ll also keep this country safe and secure, which a politician probably won&#39;t, because they&#39;re weak and ineffective. They&#39;re weak, ineffective people, politicians.</p>\n<p><strong>What do you say to the women who respond: I&#39;m not that bothered about being “cherished” or “protected” or “taken care of,” I just want to be treated equally?</strong><br>\nI think you&#39;re being politically correct when you ask me a question like that. They do want to be taken care of and they do want to be cherished and they do want to be respected, and I think when you ask a question like that you&#39;re just trying to be politically correct, that&#39;s all. But that&#39;s okay.</p>\n<p><strong>You&#39;d never say you were going to “cherish” men, would you?</strong><br>\nI would. I would. I would cherish men. I cherish all people in their lives. I think it&#39;s very important. No, I would cherish men, I would cherish women&#8212;I want to take care of everybody.</p>\n<p><strong>Obviously another issue that some people have taken&#8212;</strong><br>\n<em>[interrupts]</em> Did anybody ever say anything positive about me? This is not looking... This is not looking good. So far I haven&#39;t been asked one positive question. But that&#39;s okay. Whatever. Whatever. <em>[exhales loudly through pursed lips]</em></p>\n<p><strong>People expect you to be asked tough questions, and you&#39;re certainly up to answering them.</strong><br>\nSure I am, but, I mean, you know, so far, in all fairness, you&#39;ve only asked me, like, really negative questions. Wow. I&#39;m saying, this article&#39;s going to be a disaster. <em>[Ms. Hicks: “I think we deserve the cover just for tolerating these questions.”]</em> It&#39;s all right. Whatever.</p>\n<p><strong>A similar issue that people are giving you a hard time about is race.</strong><br>\nI don&#39;t think so. Race? Nobody&#39;s giving me a hard time. I just won… I just had the highest percentage ever in a Republican primary&#8212;25 percent of the African-Americans supported me. (3) So I don&#39;t think you&#39;re right.</p>\n<p><strong>But certainly a lot of people have written, and some people suspect, that even if you&#39;re not racist yourself, you&#39;re consciously pandering to racist sentiments in parts of the electorate.</strong><br>\n<em>[Ms. Hicks to Trump: “Shall we wrap this up?”]</em> I&#39;ve never heard that. Yeah, well, I&#39;ve never heard that. No, I mean I am the least racist person that you have ever met.</p>\n<p><strong>Obviously there&#39;s a big movement, the Black Lives Matter movement…</strong><br>\nI don&#39;t know&#8212;is it a big movement? I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s big or if it&#39;s small.</p>\n<p><strong>What do you make of it?</strong><br>\nI don&#39;t make anything of it. I saw them steal the microphone from Bernie Sanders and he just yielded, which surprised me. But no, I don&#39;t know anything about… You know, when you say it&#39;s a big movement, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a big movement. You think it&#39;s a big movement?</p>\n<p><strong>It&#39;s very hard to quantify. It&#39;s certainly a loud movement. And I think it&#39;s an interesting and important idea.</strong><br>\nYou think it is, actually? Black lives matter? But do you think white lives matter?</p>\n<p><strong>Well, the more common response is for people to say “all lives matter,” though I understand why some people consider that kind of tone-deaf.</strong><br>\nTo me, all lives matter. All lives matter.</p>\n<p><strong>But can you see how people who are fighting to point out a particular injustice&#8212;</strong><br>\n<em>[interrupts]</em> No. No, I can&#39;t. I can&#39;t understand that term, no. I think that term is hurting them, not helping them.</p>\n<p><strong>As you know, there&#39;s a lot of chatter that if the going gets tough and you go down in the polls, people think you&#39;ll just quit.</strong><br>\nThere is? I haven&#39;t…</p>\n<p><strong>You tweeted about it yesterday. (4)</strong><br>\nYeah, I mean sure, but when you say a lot of chatter, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a lot of chatter. Let&#39;s put it this way: I&#39;m in this to win this. I&#39;m not in to play games, I&#39;m not in to come in second and have everybody say how brilliant I was, and how it was the Summer of Trump&#8212;and even now the Autumn of Trump, because I&#39;m doing very well still. The summer ended a while ago.</p>\n<p><strong>I was listening to your call-in to <em>Fox and Friends Weekend</em> yesterday morning, talking about the sketch about you that opened the new season of <em>Saturday Night Live.</em> And you said that the only thing you took issue with was the wig, right?</strong><br>\nOh, terrible. It is my hair, by the way, as you know. As you can probably tell. Yeah, I thought the wig was terrible. I thought everything was fine, (5) but I thought the wig was terrible. It was just so cheap-looking to me. I&#39;d like them to get a much better-looking head of hair on the guy.</p>\n<p><strong>I guess people have been fascinated by your hair for many, many, many years. Do you understand why that is?</strong><br>\nIf you look at the way I combed it up there <em>[he gestures toward his photo gallery]</em>, I mean, it&#39;s similar, right? You know, all these years. I&#39;m a very consistent person. Amazingly consistent person. You know, it is mine. You can follow my record pictorially&#8212;look, see those magazines. It&#39;s all the same haircut, right? You know, it&#39;s sort of funny. But I&#39;ve been combing it this way for a long time, I figure I better not stop.</p>\n<p><strong>Why do you favor such an unusual style?</strong><br>\nI don&#39;t think it&#39;s that unusual. <em>[Ms. Hicks: “No.”]</em> I don&#39;t know. To me, it&#39;s not that unusual. It&#39;s not unusual because it&#39;s the way I&#39;ve been combing it for a long time, since I&#39;m in school.</p>\n<p><strong>It is unusual the way it goes forward and backward.</strong><br>\nNo, it&#39;s not really forward and it&#39;s not really… You know, if you look you know it&#39;s not actually a comb-over.</p>\n<p><strong>I guess people are interested in it now because they think it&#39;s a sign of a sort of vanity.</strong><br>\nVanity? Sure. Maybe it is, maybe it isn&#39;t. I don&#39;t know, I don&#39;t think of it. <em>[Ms. Hicks: “Everybody combs their hair, right?”]</em></p>\n<p><strong>A lot of it is because&#8212;and I don&#39;t believe this to be the case but&#8212;people don&#39;t think there&#39;s really hair there.</strong><br>\nWell, I mean, can you see it? I mean, I actually have a hairline. <em>[He lifts up the front mass so that I can see a distinct, very regular line of hairs stretching upward from the front of his scalp; I gesture that he doesn&#39;t need to do this.]</em> I actually think only the haters&#8212;they know it&#39;s real but they say it&#39;s not. There are haters that say “it&#39;s not his” because they&#39;re haters&#8212;it&#39;s what they do.</p>\n<p><strong>You&#39;ve explained how you used to praise people who are now political enemies, or people you&#39;re competing with, like Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush, (6) by…</strong><br>\nI was a businessman, and I had to get along with everybody. Now I&#39;m a politician, I guess. But when I&#39;m a businessman I get along with everybody. Boy, this is gonna be a bad article. <em>[to Ms. Hicks]</em> You think it&#39;s gonna be fine? I don&#39;t think it&#39;s gonna be fine.

bus tells you everything you need to know because the bus is a piece of shit. You would expect a Donald Trump campaign bus to be MOST LUXURIOUS, MOST DESIRED, NUMBER ONE BUS in the world, with a solid-gold chassis and marble toilets and a rooftop fuck cabana. This is not that bus. “It’s just a bus,” one Trump staffer told me, which is exactly right. It’s an old cross-country bus that still smells like an old cross-country bus, only it’s painted blue, with the name TRUMP in huge letters across both sides, plus the campaign hashtag <em>#Make America Great Again!</em> Trump says he has copyrighted it (“I’m using that a lot, and I think it’s a great statement”) even though you can’t actually put exclamation points or spaces in a hashtag.\n<p>The bus is basically a rolling version of Trump’s Atlantic City: it’s built to look nice for a single day, then it falls into disrepair the moment you’ve stopped paying attention. From a distance, though, the bus looks like a monument. You see the name, and you take in everything that name connotes&#8212;wealth, ego, poor taste&#8212;and the bus has done its job. This is Trump’s bus, and it dominates the landscape the moment it arrives. People from all around take selfies near it. Why? Because TRUMP, that’s why.</p>\n<p>And the bus is working. Perhaps you’ve noticed&#8212;or perhaps you’re trying not to notice&#8212;but Donald Trump is leading all current Republican candidates in the national polls, and his lead is growing. And so it doesn’t really matter whether you see this as an alarming sign of the nation’s growing lunacy, or as a reckoning for a GOP that has been awash for years in hateful rhetoric, or as a byproduct of Trump’s masterful ability to hijack all political coverage by embracing his role as America’s Master Idiot. He’s doing it. At least for a brief moment, he’s winning. And he may extend his lead once the GOP debates begin Thursday night. Trump has managed to plaster his name all over this election as if it were one of his overpriced condos, and he has drawn the crowds as a result.</p>\n<p>And these are real voters out here who are responding to him: real voters who are lining up for his rallies in large numbers (not as large as Trump claims, but still!), real voters who hang on every word of his ridiculous pitch for how he will wheel and deal America back to the top.</p>\n<p>But who the fuck are these people? Are they blind? Are they crazy? Have they been brainwashed by all the giant signs? Or is it possible they see something in Trump that the rest of us don’t? What makes someone want to seriously consider voting for this man? I didn’t know what the answer was, but I wanted to see for myself. I needed to make it make sense. So I went to Iowa&#8212;Iowa: The State You Grew Up Swearing You’d Leave One Day!™&#8212;to meet them. And to see The Donald in the flesh.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Every election dispatch from Iowa is required to include a bit of scenery-setting, to show you just how folksy Iowa is: corn, state fairs, dragonflies, balloon museums, smiling fat babies, etc.</p>\n<p>This is not the Iowa I visited. The Donald Trump Make America Great Again Rally and Family Picnic was held in Oskaloosa, a small town 60 miles east of Des Moines. Oskaloosa is like a lot of small Midwestern towns right now: crumbling houses, shuttered businesses, half-empty strip malls.  You are surrounded by loss here. One of the few thriving businesses I saw in town, apart from a kickass bar called The Cellar Peanut Pub, was a video store. An actual video store. They didn’t even have to rent porn to stay solvent. They had customers, <em>and</em> they were hiring.</p>\n<p>Oskaloosa has been left behind in the Information Age. What has left here is never coming back, no matter what any politician or businessman promises. And people in Osky&#8212;the locals call it “Osky”&#8212;don’t look pleased about this. Contrary to friendly Midwestern stereotypes, they look PISSED. Every man I saw in town looked like your father-in-law the first time you met him at the door. Out on the empty roads, the only vehicles are big, angry pickup trucks with huge side mirrors sticking way out, like they wanna punch your car. People here are aggrieved. People here have had a lot of disappointment, and they are sick of it.</p>\n<p>Like Karen and Diane. Along with a bunch of friends and family, they showed up early this morning to the 696-seat George Daily Community Auditorium (which Oskaloosa’s middle school and high school share) so they could get as close to their billionaire savior as possible. To “see the color of his eyes,” Diane said. I greeted their group as they waited by the door, many of them sitting in nylon golf chairs, nervous about losing their spot in line.</p>\n<p>“I like that Trump won’t back down,” Karen told me. “He says what he means and he means what he’s saying. He ain’t going to say he’s sorry. Sometimes he likes to say things not politically correct, but they all better get used to that. The people who do speak politically correct have been losers.”</p>\n<p>“They constipated America!” Diane said, rocking a House of Blues t-shirt. “What we have had is politicians and lawyers who have constipated America. Let’s get a businessman in there and get things moving! We need our new MiraLAX!”</p>\n<p><em>Do you believe everything Trump says?</em></p>\n<p>“At this point, I’m inclined to say he’s not lying.”</p>\n<p><em>Do you think he exaggerates sometimes?</em></p>\n<p>“Oh yeah. Who doesn’t?”</p>\n<p>“He is for America,” Karen says. “He is for the elderly. He is for the quiet people.”</p>\n<p>Who are “<em>the quiet people</em>”?</p>\n<p>“The people like us, that a lot of times walk around with the attitude that, ‘Oh, it doesn’t matter what I think. I’m just from Osky.’ You know? <em>The quiet people</em>. The people who don’t think they have a voice.”</p>\n<p>Karen used to live in Arizona, where she had a job at a semiconductor plant, adding gold buttons to each chip in on anassembly line. But the plant was relocated to China, and so she lost her job and relocated here. As you could probably surmise, she likes Trump’s tough talk about foreigners stealing our jobs. I had arrived in Iowa just as Trump was doubling down on his comments that Mexico was sending “rapists” across our border; people here loved it, and seemed oddly emotional about the subject of immigration, even though Iowa is nowhere near the border. Apparently, it’s not just the immigrants from <em>Mexico</em> that concern Iowans for Trump. “We need to get the Muslims out of the country,” a man named Bob with a swirling white beard told me, “before they start killing our families!” Everyone around him nodded.</p>\n<p>The line to see Trump grew longer and stretched across the front of Oskaloosa middle school. A local Hy-Vee supermarket put up picnic tables and gave away bottled water, potato salad, pulled pork, and hot dogs thick as flashlights. Elderly people tooted around on Rascal scooters. An enterprising man hocked all-purpose GOP fanboy buttons with slogans like BENGHAZI MATTERS.</p>\n<p>I met an old couple wearing matching Trump t-shirts, which they told me they wore every day. “I haven’t had one bad comment on it,” said the wife. I met a man named Wayne who voted for Obama twice but was now firmly in Trump’s corner. I met ANOTHER man named Wayne who walked me carefully through his five-point rationale for why Trump was the best candidate. (Voters often show up at these rallies with little stump speeches of their own.) I met a woman named Jill who showed up with several hand-drawn signs. (My favorite was “Beltway Talks; Trump Works.”) Jill was <em>fired the fuck up</em> for some Trump in her life. I don’t know how it’s possible to be so fired up with the election so far away, but Jill was <em>blazing</em>. She wanted to make sure the whole world knew that Trump and his voters were for real.</p>\n<p>“I was terribly insulted when [John McCain] called us crazies,” Jill told me.</p>\n<p><em>What is it that you like so much about Trump?</em></p>\n<p>“He’s a capitalist,” Jill explained. “That inspires me.”</p>\n<p>I also ran into a very rare minority in the crowd&#8212;a Pakistani woman who emigrated here from Pakistan 40 years ago and didn’t like the idea of anyone skirting the naturalization process.</p>\n<p>“I came in the right way,” she told me. “When you try to do things the right way, it doesn’t work. And all these illegals sneaking in, and being able to stay&#8212;how do they get to do that?”</p>\n<p><em>And you think Trump will make things fairer</em>.</p>\n<p>“Well, as long as he does a better job than what’s being done. You know?”</p>\n<p>A nervous drug counselor named Tracy was also in line to see Trump. Unlike some of the others, she had some concerns about him. Well, one: “He’s an atheist,” she said.</p>\n<p>A man nearby overheard us talking and told us he shared her worry. “We have to elect godly men.”</p>\n<p>But Jill&#8212;the sign lady&#8212;cut into the conversation and came to the rescue: “He’s not an atheist. I wanted to correct that. He explained the church he’s gone to his whole life. He didn’t articulate it as well as he should have. But you know what? That articulation&#8212;I’m not concerned with that.”</p>\n<p>That seemed to cool Tracy’s hangups about Trump being a godless heathen.</p>\n<p>And I spotted a woman pushing around a stroller with a photograph of a live abortion taped to it, along with a big sign that read “DEAR PLANNED PARENTHOOD, I AM NOT FOR SALE.” For some reason, the woman ditched the stroller in the middle of the path leading to the auditorium, and a squat veteran named Randy went to alert the police. “That’s a good way to get a bomb brought in,” he said. While we all stared at the stroller, looking for any suspicious bulges (it turned out to be clean), Randy explained to me why he had a big ol’ Trump-on.</p>\n<p>“I like what he has to say. He won’t take no shit from nobody.”</p>\n<p><em>What’s your favorite thing he’s said?</em></p>\n<p>“You’re fired!”</p>\n<p><em>Who would you like him to fire, besides Obama?</em></p>\n<p>“Let’s see: John Kerry, our last governor, the attorney general, every Muslim that they put in…”</p>\n<p>Randy seemed untroubled by Trump’s lack of polish, or knowledge, or basic human grace. Far from it&#8212;these were virtues. “You don’t have to be a brain to run a business,” Randy said. “Just an ass. Sometimes you can be nice and polite, but there’s sometimes you’ve just got to be a horse’s ass with somebody to get them to do what they’re supposed to be doing.”</p>\n<p>So far, I’d heard Trump compared&#8212;favorably&#8212;to a horse’s ass and to a laxative, and I began to imagine a Trump campaign poster that was just a big horse’s butthole spewing hot diarrhea.</p>\n<p><em>So you believe Trump has the fearlessness to run this country?</em></p>\n<p>“I know he does,” said Randy. “Have you ever watched <em>The Apprentice?</em>”</p>\n<p>I talked to more voters and a pattern emerged in the answers. Trump was “honest,” “not PC,” “authentic,” “shooting from the hip,” and “called a spade a spade.” And of course, he wasn’t from Washington. He was gonna get in there and shake things up.</p>\n<p>We’ve heard all of this before, from many, many other candidates. Every presidential election has at least one magical, imaginary OUTSIDER&#8212;that teenage wet dream of a president who rides into Washington, tells those bureaucrats what shitheads they are, and bulldozes Congress into doing cool shit simply with the power of his huge cock. I have fallen for this kind of candidate. YOU have fallen for this kind of candidate. Everybody wants this mythical Bulworth to exist, but at this level of politics, there are no outsiders, and the game changes its rules for no one.</p>\n<p>And yet, people buy in. Maybe this time, they think, the guy who says he’s different really is different.</p>\n<p>And Trump, to his credit, is definitely different.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Noon was approaching and the doors to the auditorium opened. Trump supporters poured into seats in front of the stage and onto a set of risers behind the podium. The hated media&#8212;that would include me&#8212;sat toward the back.</p>\n<p>After a couple of introductory speeches from a local politician and a member of Seal Team Seven (not Six, but Seven&#8212;they’re one better!), we were greeted by former <em>Apprentice</em> runner-up Tana Goertz, who also happens to be Trump 2016’s Iowa co-chair and a “well-known Bedazzler spokeswoman.”</p>\n<p>“We all know how much Donald Trump is worth!” Goertz cried out, inaccurately. “How much?” The response from the crowd was messy and overlapping&#8212;many wild guesses called out at once.</p>\n<p>“I’ve met a lot of smart people,” Goertz continued, undaunted, “but I have never met a man that thinks about working when other people are talking about working.”</p>\n<p><em>Wait, what?</em></p>\n<p>“At the heart of it all, he’s a builder. Who better than Donald Trump to rebuild this country?”</p>\n<p>Okay, that’s a metaphor I can get behind.</p>\n<p>“You have never ever in your life experienced what you’re about to experience today. I’m just going to say: Sit back, put on your seatbelt. It’s going to be a fun ride. You will enjoy the experience and the ride, which is Donald Trump.”</p>\n<p>Finally&#8212;after a quick Pledge of Allegiance&#8212;the man himself emerged through a side door, carried aloft by the strains of Joe Esposito’s “You’re The Best.”</p>\n<p>I saw the hair first. It arrived in two parts: first the Turtle Wax-ed strands that run along both sides of his scalp, then the champagne glitter yarn kit perched top. I’d never seen Trump before, and the hair was all that I’d hoped for, and more. And after announcing his intention to molest all of Iowa’s chief export (“I want to grab that corn like you’ve never seen&#8212;so beautiful”) the ride started up.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>I’m gonna say a few nice things about Donald Trump now. If that terrifies you, then by all means, skim through this section and carry on with your existence.</p>\n<p>But I must tell you that, in person, Donald Trump is a very entertaining public speaker. And is this really such a surprise? Ever since* The Art of the Deal*, Trump has spent decades giving speeches all over the country, acting as our Get-Rich-Quick godfather. When he gets in front of a microphone, he requires no notes. No teleprompter. He is confident. He is casual. He is charming. Everyone is a “great guy” or an “amazing negotiator.”</p>\n<p>He can even be funny. When I texted a friend from the event that Trump was hilarious in person, he texted back, “NO. No no no.” Sorry, it’s true. It’s still not clear whether he’s in on the joke&#8212;there’s always been a bit of mystery to how aware Donald Trump is that Donald Trump is full of shit. But when you see him in person, and you hear him claim that the term “Supreme Leader” would be more fitting for him than for the head of Iran, there is the tiniest hint that he knows what a ludicrous thing this is to say. Even his exaggerations are hilarious. He said this was the biggest crowd in state history, even though we were in a public-school auditorium. He said he was worth more than $10 billion, a figure that is impossible for him to prove but also impossible for us to disprove. He said he made $213 million from <em>The Apprentice</em>, a figure which NBC steadfastly refutes.</p>\n<p>At one point, Trump boasted about how much veterans adore him. To prove it, he trotted out a gorgeous brunette who was carrying a perfect stack of white paper topped with a bow. I swear it looked like an unwrapped package of blank Hammermill printer paper. “In one day,” Trump blared, “many hundreds of letters from Vietnam vets, thanking me. This is from veterans. Each page, a different letter. It’s amazing.”</p>\n<p>Everyone ate it up. They laughed and cheered and hollered out in approval all through his speech.  It was more like a late-night monologue, and true to his reputation, Trump is not careful with his words. You can see why people think he’s more “honest” than one of the other randos in the GOP field&#8212;he’s gifted at not sounding like a politician even as he deploys standard tricks from the “I’m not a politician” handbook. He is definitely more fun to watch than Bobby Jindal. I wish there were more Trump-like candidates out there who are not Donald Trump, if that makes any sense.</p>\n<p>He also made a good point or two in between all the noise. At one point he bellowed: “I read Jeb Bush raised over a hundred million dollars. Now if you think that those people giving him all those money aren’t getting a lot, you’re wrong. All of these people are controlled by the people who gave them their money.” He’s right! It’s true! Holy shit, Donald Trump said a true thing. I heard it with my own two ears.</p>\n<p>If Donald Trump has one undeniable virtue as a politician, it’s that he does not try to fake being one of us. He’s not going to the fucking Bowl-o-Rama on a Saturday night in a plaid shirt to prove he’s a man of the people. The whole thrust of The Donald’s campaign is that he is special. He is extraordinary. In Osky, he compared his business acumen to Jack Nicklaus’ golfing ability and Babe Ruth’s hitting ability. (“It’s called talent. <em>Talent</em>.”) He is a WINNER, and he is here to help this nation of sad losers learn how to win again.</p>\n<p>“We don’t win anymore in this country,” he told the crowd. “When was the last time we won? When did we beat China in a deal? We don’t win.”</p>\n<p>Well, Trump is here to fix all that losing. And here is where my brief jag of mildly effusive praise for Donald Trump must come to an end, because the grim undercurrent of his rise is SHAME.  After all, if you believe we must make America great again, then you must also believe that America, at the present moment, sucks. And pretty much everyone at the Trump picnic believed that America sucks. When I asked a group of Trump supporters outside if they were proud of America, they all laughed with derision. <em>Of course</em> they weren’t proud of America. Of course this nation is a shithole. One voter named Corey told me he hoped Trump would help America “get back to the way it was,” a refrain I heard from a lot of people, as if the country was a rock band that had changed its sound. Backing Trump means acknowledging that you live in a world of failure, and that your last best hope is the Music Man moseying into town.</p>\n<p>Now, here is how Donald Trump says he will Make America Great Again™. In Trump’s worldview, politics is little more than series of deals to be made. Every complex global problem, or intractable adversary, can be tamed with sufficiently hard-ass steakhouse dealmaking. He explained it all in Osky:</p>\n<p>“I know the greatest negotiators in the world,” he said. “Now some of these people are horrible human beings. You wouldn’t have them to dinner. They’re vicious. They’re crude. They’re unhappy. They treat everybody badly. Who cares? I want them negotiating against China. Think of Carl Icahn, a friend of mine. He’d be great. I’d say, ‘Carl, take China’.”</p>\n<p>Now, people applauded this, which alarmed me because (A) Who has friends like this? And (B) Sending a vicious, crude, unhappy person who treats everyone badly to go yell FUCK YOU at the Chinese strikes me as unwise.</p>\n<p>But Trump is so certain, so supremely confident, that everyone at his rallies go for the idea anyway. It comes off as an act of counterintuitive genius. What’s not to like about the idea that you can fix everything by just marching into Washington and yelling at all the dummies to stop being dummies? I wish politics were that simple. I really do. Politics <em>should</em> be that simple. Trump’s gift is that he really can make it sound that easy, even when it’s all a huge lie. His swagger is <em>your</em> swagger. He can reduce entire countries down to a cardboard persona. He’ll get tough with Mexico. He’ll have Carl take China. The way Trump explains it, you’d think China had only one person in it.</p>\n<p>Trump is so certain of his horseshit that, on that stage in Osky, he laid out a remarkable future scenario of him in the Oval Office that was essentially one enormous lie that hasn’t had the chance to become a lie yet. Here now is what President Trump would do if Ford tried to build a manufacturing plant down in Mexico:</p>\n<p>“It’s so easy. <em>It’s too easy</em>. I do it with a phone call. I call the head of Ford, and I say, ‘Every single car and truck that comes into the US, we’re going to tax you 35 percent’.”</p>\n<p>Massive applause! Trump wasn’t done.</p>\n<p>“So this isn’t 99.9 percent&#8212;this is <em>one hundred percent</em> what’s going to happen: He’ll call me back, probably that afternoon, but he may play it tough and call me back the next day. The next day I’ll get a call from Ben Ford”&#8212;NOTE: there is no Ben Ford; I assume he meant Bill&#8212;“and he’ll say, ‘Mr. President, we decided not to build that plant. We’ll build it in the United States.’”</p>\n<p>And everyone in the joint bought it! They damn near broke their hands clapping for this idea! I almost bought it myself! At least, I did for half a second before I thought, <em>Wait, don’t you need Congress to approve shit like that? And wouldn’t forcing the plant to be built here increase the cost of Fords? And then wouldn’t people stop buying Fords? And then wouldn’t Ford go belly up, costing us even MORE jobs than if we had just left the goddamn plant in Mexico? And what about the many, many Fords that are already produced in Mexico?</em></p>\n<p>But a Trump rally isn’t about thinking more than half a second ahead. There is a first BOLD step, and then you are left to assume that everything else will fall neatly into place. In Trump’s white-trash, Louis XIV universe, all you see is the pretty gold paint before it starts chipping off the walls.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Money, ironically, is what will likely wind up being Trump’s political downfall. Once the primary field has been winnowed down to a few schlubs, the GOP establishment will dump its funds into a single candidate with the goal of overtaking Trump, whom they all despise. (Yet one more reason why voters here love him, by the way.) And as rich Trump may claim to be, there are limits to how much of his personal fortune he’ll spend on this effort.</p>\n<p>Once the GOP muscles him out, Trump may very well run a third-party campaign that divides conservative voters and all but hands the 2016 election to a waiting Hillary Clinton. In Osky, this was every thinking Trump voter’s nightmare scenario. “As long as he doesn’t split parties, I’m there,” one attendee told me. “If he does that, it’s too important of an election.” But it could happen. And if it does, Trump may go from the darling of far-right conservatives voters to their most-hated nemesis.</p>\n<p>At the end of Trump’s speech, “We’re Not Gonna Take It” by Twisted Sister boomed through the speakers and played him off the stage.  The crowd grave him a standing O on his way out. The ride was over. The reviews outside were glowing: “Awesome.” “I loved his demeanor.” “Solutions.” “It’s nice to hear somebody talk who’s not a politician.” They were all sold. They were all going to home to preach the gospel of their King Midas.</p>\n<p>As I watched everyone file out, I thought of a moment during Tana Goertz’s opening-act speech earlier in the day, when she pleaded with everyone to eat more of the food outside. “Mr. Trump can’t take all this food home on the plane,” she told us. “There’s not enough room.” And so as all of Trump’s energized constituents filed out of the joint, I pictured him getting onto his plane, cigar in the corner of his mouth, jetting back to the Land of Winners. And I pictured everyone else stuck back here in Osky, with nothing but the scraps he left behind for all the quiet people.</p>","channel":"News & Culture","subChannel":"Politics","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"identifiable":true,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"revisionAuthor":"Freddie Campion","issueDate":"","hed":"What Kind of Person Would Vote For Donald Trump?

He couldn’t always harness it. He couldn’t stop trying to win everyone over, whether it was a <em>60 Minutes</em> correspondent, 500 powerful donors in a crowded banquet hall, or a fetching woman on a rope line.\n<p>If Clinton acted like someone who ran Capitol Records, Obama&#8212;both the person <em>and</em> the president&#8212;carries himself like Roger Federer, a merciless competitor who keeps coming and coming, only there’s a serenity about him that\ndisarms just about everyone. At one point during the hour I spent interviewing him at the White House this fall, he casually compared himself to Aaron Rodgers, and he wasn’t bragging. Obama identified with Rodgers’s ability to keep his focus downfield despite all the chaos happening in front of him. That’s Obama’s enduring quality,\nand (to borrow another sports term) this has been his “career year.”</p>\n<p>Obama lives in America’s most famous museum and uses it to his advantage. You’re sitting there in some ancient tearoom waiting for him to show up, surrounded by portraits of former first ladies and framed maps from battles\nthat America won over the centuries. Everyone is friendly but suspicious. Everyone talks in hushed tones. You feel like you’re intruding at all times. You’re just…waiting. Suddenly, ten anonymous security guards pop out of hallways\nand doorways that you didn’t know were there. The energy shifts. And then, there’s Obama&#8212;big smile, big handshake, some ball-busting comments to put everyone at ease. Within seconds of greeting me, he was poking fun at my shoes and teasing me for not writing anymore.</p>\n<p>“It’s really aggravating not having you on Grantland,” he said, almost like I betrayed him. “I go to the site and there’s no Simmons. Come on, man, it’s not the same.”</p>\n<p>It’s an alpha-male trick&#8212;put someone off-balance, flatter them and bust their chops at the same time. A few minutes later, he was grabbing control of the interview with measured responses, knowing that he didn’t have to perform\nwithout cameras or podcast equipment. And so he took his time. And it worked. I mean, how do you interrupt the most powerful man on earth? It felt like the way Federer repeatedly jumped Novak Djokovic’s second serve in the 2015 U.S. Open Final&#8212;a savvy trick to disrupt someone’s flow, a seemingly harmless way to gain an edge. It’s what the great competitors do.</p>\n<p>In January, Obama will begin his eighth and final year on the job. It’s an <em>era</em> now. What has he learned about leadership? What was his biggest regret? Why did it seem like, in 2015, he finally started letting it fly, threw on his Beefsquatch costume and let everyone know “THIS IS ME NOW!” Gay marriage, health care, Charleston, the Iran deal… If you voted against him, 2015 was the year when his inner confidence bothered you more than ever. And if you voted for him, 2015 was definitely the year when you said, “<em>That</em> is the guy I voted for.” But what if Barack Obama has been that guy all along?</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>BILL SIMMONS: If you could go back to 2008 and tell yourself one thing, what would it be?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>BARACK OBAMA:</strong> “You’re going to be busy.” Coming in, we were going through an unprecedented economic upheaval, combined with an upheaval in the Middle East that we hadn’t seen in our lifetimes. There was going\nto be a huge amount of disruption. I would probably tell myself to communicate more effectively early on than I did. We ran a great campaign. It wasn’t as great as it seems in retrospect&#8212;there’s always rose-colored glasses but there’s no doubt that we captured the country’s imagination. And somehow in those first two years, I think a certain arrogance crept in, in the sense of thinking as long as we get the policy ready, we didn’t have to sell it.</p>\n<p>One thing I learned through some tough election cycles: You can’t separate good policy from the need to bring the American people along and make sure that they know why you’re doing what you’re doing. And that’s particularly\ntrue now in this new communications era. I think that we were ahead of the curve in 2008 in social media and the Internet and digital communications. When we came into office, instead of taking some of those lessons, we\nsuddenly adapted ourselves to the White House press room and structures that had been built back in the 1940s and ’50s. As a consequence of those missteps early, we got the policies right, and that’s why the economy now has grown for five and a half straight years, six years, and why unemployment rates have gone from 10 percent to 5.1 percent. But there was a lot of political pain along the way that might not have been necessary.</p>\n<p><strong>Was there a point in those first three years where you started to feel overwhelmed by the job? Where you\nwere just like, “My God, I just had no idea this was going to be this hard!”</strong><br>\nI had a pretty good handle. One thing I learned during the campaign was that I’ve got a good temperament. I don’t get too high and I don’t get too low. I’m able to stay focused even when there’s a lot of stuff going on around me.</p>\n<p><strong>So you’re like Gregg Popovich. Although he does get mad at sideline reporters.</strong><br>\n<em>[laughs]</em> He does. So do I. <em>[laughs]</em> Yeah. Or maybe [Aaron] Rodgers in the pocket, in the sense of you can’t be distracted by what’s around you, you’ve got to be looking downfield. And I think that’s a quality that I have&#8212;not getting flustered in what’s around me. So there was never a point, even early on&#8212;even in the first six months, where we weren’t sure whether we were going to dip into another Great Depression, we weren’t sure whether the steps we were taking on rescuing the auto industry or stabilizing the financial system were going to work&#8212;there weren’t moments where I thought, “Sheesh, feels like we’re in over our head.”</p>\n<p>But what I didn’t fully appreciate, and nobody can appreciate until they’re in the position, is how decentralized power is in this system. When you’re in the seat and you’re seeing the housing market collapse and you are seeing unemployment skyrocketing and you have a sense of what the right thing to do is, then you realize, “Okay, not only do I have to persuade my own party, not only do I have to prevent the other party from blocking what the right thing to do is, but now I can anticipate this lawsuit, this lobbying taking place, and this federal agency that technically is independent, so I can’t tell them what to do. I’ve got the Federal Reserve, and I’m hoping that they do the right thing&#8212;and by the way, since the economy now is global, I’ve got to make sure that the Europeans, the Asians, the Chinese, everybody is on board.” A lot of the work is not just identifying the right policy but now constantly building these ever shifting coalitions to be able to actually implement and execute and get it done.</p>\n<p><strong>You’re out to dinner with your wife and the phone rings. How many of the people in your life are you like, “Uh-oh, I’ve got to take this”?</strong><br>\nMalia and Sasha. <em>[laughs]</em> And maybe my mother-in-law. My national security adviser, Susan Rice, and Denis McDonough, my chief of staff. Those are the only people whose call I would take during a date night with Michelle. But the entire White House is full of people who have enormous responsibilities. You can’t do this by yourself. The principle of team building in the White House is really no different than the principle of team building anywhere, on a sports team or a well-run business. Do they put team ahead of themselves? Do you make sure all the pieces fit together? Because just having the best athletes, if they’re knocking heads and nobody’s doing rebounding and everybody wants the ball, it isn’t always going to work.</p>\n<p><strong>Is it fair to say that in 2015, you’ve been like the second-semester high school senior who got into Yale and now is like, “I’m going out tonight&#8212;I don’t care if I have a test tomorrow”? All of us were kind of waiting for that guy to show up after he got re-elected. What took two years to get there?</strong><br>\nThere’s no doubt that the longer I’m in this job, the more confident I am about the decisions I’m making and more knowledgeable about the responses I can expect. And as a consequence, you end up being looser. There’s not much I have not seen at this point, and I know what to expect, and I can anticipate more than I did before.</p>\n<p>I [also] have a case to make now that was harder to make earlier in my presidency. We had confidence, for example, that the economic decisions that we made to stabilize the financial system and pass Wall Street reform and raise\ntaxes on the wealthiest and pass health care&#8212;that would have a payoff. But because we had been in such a deep hole, we had to be careful about crowing success when people weren’t feeling it. And it wasn’t really until around 2014 where the attitude of the American people was, “The economy’s improving, I’m feeling better.”</p>\n<p><strong>So you feed off that.</strong><br>\nYou can make your case without caveats, which, I think, hampered my ability to communicate confidence and optimism to people. You didn’t want people to feel as if you were getting ahead of yourself. It’s a combination of me feeling looser because I’ve just been in this job a long time and have gone through some tough stretches. Not only do you not look like you have any fear, but you actually <em>don’t</em> have any fear. And I don’t at this point. The bets we made early on have paid off. Some of it does have to do with luck.</p>\n<p>Think about 2013, right after I’d been re-elected: Our goal was to lead with a big push on immigration reform. And then, before the second inauguration has even happened, [the school shooting at] Sandy Hook happens. Which remains, by the way, the worst few days of my presidency. I went up and visited with those families and&#8212;you know, Bill, you’ve still got small kids. These are 6-year-olds, right? And you have 20 of them who’ve been massacred. Right away, our focus had to shift to “Is there a way for us to capture this moment to see if we can get over this incredible hump to try to put in place some common-sense gun-safety rules?” And we knew it was a stretch, just because of the politics of Congress and the NRA. But we had to try.</p>\n<p>And throughout 2013 and 2014, you had a series of events like that&#8212;the Snowden disclosures, Ebola, Ferguson, ISIL, and unaccompanied children coming across the borders&#8212;all sort of stacked up in a row. None of them individually unsolvable, but given the 24/7 news cycle, they just sort of pile up on each other. Even though, in the midst of this, the economy is improving and we are making real progress on education and health care and energy and so forth, political momentum turns sharply against you. And so we’ve had more than our share of stormy seas, but we’ve navigated the ship well.</p>\n<p><strong>When Ferguson happened last year, I was waiting for Obama the Person to come in. But you had to be President Obama. How you handled Charleston this year and Selma&#8212;that was Obama the Person. So what happened with Ferguson? Do you wish you had handled that differently?</strong><br>\nYou know, the challenge of Ferguson and all issues related to police shootings, race, and the criminal-justice system is that in order to actually get something done, you have to build consensus. Expressing simple outrage without\nfollow-up is often counterproductive. In the case of Ferguson, I’m the attorney general’s boss. If I chime in with a strong opinion about what’s happened, not only do I stand to potentially damage subsequent law-enforcement cases, but immediately you get blowback and backlash that may make people less open to listening. What was different in Charleston was the clarity of what happened&#8212;that allowed, I think, everybody to be open to it.</p>\n<p><strong>Did it take time during the presidency to realize what kind of moments those were?</strong><br>\nYes, sometimes it’s feel. Sometimes the circumstances won’t give you a clean statement. The fact that race has always been the fault line of our society and has always distorted our politics&#8212;that is not subject to argument. Part of what you’re looking for is a way not to just vent but to actually move the people. I practiced law for a while&#8212;a lot of times, hard cases can make bad law. If you have an issue that you want to put forward, you’re looking for the right plaintiff and the right court to appear before. I do think as you go on as president, you get a better feel for this, but you’re not always going to be perfect. When the Trayvon Martin case happened, I had an honest response as a father that I think resonated with a lot of people. When Ferguson happened, there was a gap between how quickly we could pull together a police task force, recommendations. And so in that lag, it feels as if I haven’t spoken to the moment as effectively. I suspect that if I were to do it over again, there might be something I could say that would’ve crystallized it more effectively. But Ferguson&#8212;the case itself was tougher because people didn’t know what was going on exactly. In some ways the [Eric] Garner case in New York was clearer because you had on videotape exactly what had happened, and some of the subsequent cases have been more obvious.</p>\n<p>One thing you learn as president is you’re not always going to perform flawlessly and you have to be able to put that out of your mind and then look at the next problem coming down the pipe. If I’m working out in the gym, sometimes I’ll go to NBA Classics and watch some of these old classic games&#8212;</p>\n<p><strong>The lack of HD really hurts&#8212;you can barely see anybody.</strong><br>\nIt’s true&#8212;and the graphics at the bottom are terrible. But a thing that you’re reminded of, watching those old Bulls games, is Jordan had some stinker games in the playoffs. But he would get that out of his mind, and then the next moment comes and he’s right there. He could have a terrible game for the first three quarters and then suddenly go crazy the fourth. Or he might miss a free throw, and then the next play is he’s stealing the ball and hitting the game-winning shot. Part of what I try to do&#8212;not at the level that Jordan did on the basketball court, but part of what you aspire to as president or any of these positions of leadership&#8212;is to try to figure out how to be in the moment, make the best decision you can, know that you’re going to get a bunch of them right, but a bunch of times you’re also not going to get it exactly the way you want it.</p>\n<p><strong>You win the election in 2008, and Twitter is just becoming a thing. Over the course of your presidency, that’s the biggest thing that’s changed. What’s the biggest challenge with all that stuff?</strong><br>\nSpeed. You are on 24/7&#8212;you have to respond immediately. The job of our office, to keep up and to respond quickly to anything that’s happening but not be consumed by it, is completely different. We’ve been building a digital team inside the White House.</p>\n<p><strong>When did that start?</strong><br>\nToo late. That’s an example of something that I would’ve started earlier. That was a lesson that coming out of the first term, I should’ve understood. That’s why we built this team. It’s so interesting watching my daughters. Both are complete ninjas on the phone, right? And they can do things that I don’t even understand&#8212;they’re doing it in two seconds. But I even see a difference between Malia, who’s 17, and Sasha, who’s 14. There’s almost a mini-generational gap in terms of Sasha being so connected seamlessly to this smartphone in a way that Malia, who was already a little bit older when it really started to take, is not.</p>\n<p><strong>The ability to multitask with 19 different friends at the same time…</strong><br>\nYeah. And just the degree to which her social life is so connected to that. So it’s not just having to change how we do business inside the White House to react to stories, but also, how do we tell a story about issues to constituencies that are completely splintered, who don’t watch television in the same way, who don’t watch the news in the same way? In some ways we’re just laying the foundation for what I assume will be the standard practice of future presidents.</p>\n<p><strong>Gun control: You’ve tried to legislate it as much as you possibly could and hit a wall basically in every direction. But the one thing Hillary Clinton has brought up is executive action.</strong><br>\nWell, keep in mind that after Sandy Hook, we put forward 23 executive actions. So we haven’t been asleep at the switch in terms of executive actions that we’ve tried. There are maybe a few more that had to be scrubbed by lawyers because, essentially, with every executive action, we can count on it being challenged by somebody in Congress or, in this case, the NRA. We want to make any executive action we take as defensible as possible legally. In the absence of a movement politically in which people say, “Enough is enough,” we’re going to continue to see, unfortunately, these tragedies take place. The main thing that I’ve been trying to communicate over the last several of these horrific episodes is that, contrary to popular belief, Americans are not more violent than people in other developed countries. But they have more deadly weapons to act out their rage, and that’s the only main variable that you see between the U.S. and these other countries.</p>\n<p><strong>It does feel like it’s going to become the dominant issue of year eight.</strong><br>\nI hope so. We have this weird habit in this culture of mourning and, you know, 48, 72 hours of wall-to-wall coverage, and then…suddenly we move on. And I will do everything I can to make sure that there’s a sustained attention paid to this thing.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s the most entertaining conspiracy theory you ever read about yourself?</strong><br>\nThat military exercises we were doing in Texas were designed to begin martial law so that I could usurp the Constitution and stay in power longer. Anybody who thinks I could get away with telling Michelle I’m going to be president any longer than eight years does not know my wife.</p>\n<p><strong>Have you ever said, “Give me the JFK-assassination files, I want to read them. Give me all the secret stuff”?</strong><br>\nI gotta tell you, it’s a little disappointing. People always ask me about Roswell and the aliens and UFOs, and it turns out the stuff going on that’s top secret isn’t nearly as exciting as you expect. In this day and age, it’s not as top secret as you’d think.</p>\n<p><strong>Would you ever want to be a Supreme Court justice?</strong><br>\n<em>[pauses]</em></p>\n<p><strong>You paused!</strong><br>\nNo&#8212;well, the reason I paused for a second was just to make sure that I let people know that I think good judges are really important, and Supreme Court justices, obviously, are hugely important. I don’t have the temperament to sit in relative solitude and just opine and write from the bench. I want to be in the action a little bit more.</p>\n<p><strong>Is it true you have a virtual driving range in the White House?</strong><br>\nTrue.</p>\n<p><strong>It’s in the bowels of the White House?</strong><br>\nYeah, I mean, this is not like some super-fancy thing. But I can hit these Wiffle balls.</p>\n<p><strong>So you go down there and hit, like as a stress reliever?</strong><br>\nYeah. Just whack ’em. Whack ’em around a little bit.</p>\n<p><strong>Has anyone come to the White House and picked up your older daughter for a date?</strong><br>\nNo, but I’ve seen some folks glancing at her in ways that made me not happy.</p>\n<p><strong>Tell the Secret Service, “Just take out that guy over there”?</strong><br>\n“Just keep an eye on him.”</p>\n<p><strong>Does it scare you that your wife could have a billion-dollar daytime talk show and you could be Stedman 2.0?</strong><br>\n<em>[laughs]</em> Uh…</p>\n<p><strong>Because that’s in play. She could do that if she wanted.</strong><br>\nAnd if that’s what she wants to do, I’m okay with her making a whole lot of money. There’s nothing wrong with that.</p>\n<p><strong>Would you ever want to be part of the ownership for an NBA team?</strong><br>\nAbsolutely.</p>\n<p><strong>Would it have to be the Bulls, or would it have to be somebody else?</strong><br>\nWell, you know, I know [Jerry] Reinsdorf pretty good&#8212;he’s not giving that thing up anytime soon. But I have fantasized about being able to put together a team and how much fun that would be. I think it’d be terrific.</p>\n<p><strong>How many times have you said to your kids, “Stop Googling me”?</strong><br>\nI don’t have to tell them that. They have no interest in me. I mean, they’re hopefully interested in me as a father.</p>\n<p><strong>Not as a public figure. What’s your guiltiest-pleasure TV show? Don’t say <em>Game of Thrones</em>, because that’s a good show.</strong><br>\nProbably the guiltiest pleasure&#8212;and this is kind of lame&#8212;is <em>Big Break</em>. You know, on the Golf Channel? Which is kind of a silly show. <em>[laughs]</em> But I find it really relaxing.</p>\n<p><strong>So you watch it on the treadmill or something?</strong><br>\nYeah, when I’m working out sometimes late at night. I never see all the episodes, but if they’ve got some chipping contest or something… <em>[laughs]</em> It’s pretty lame. I do love <em>Game of Thrones</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Which character do you identify with?</strong><br>\nMy favorite character is probably…the dwarf, what’s his name?</p>\n<p><strong>Oh, yeah. Peter Dinklage’s character.</strong><br>\nThe problem with <em>Game of Thrones,</em> though, is that I don’t remember the names of any of the characters.</p>\n<p><strong>I don’t, either.</strong><br>\nI remember the characters, so when I watch it, I know exactly what’s going on. But if you read a review of the show afterwards and they’re mentioning such and such, the only one I remember is Jon Snow, because I can pronounce Jon Snow.</p>\n<p><strong>Which <em>Game of Thrones</em> character is Donald Trump?</strong><br>\nUh…I don’t think…I don’t think any of them rise to that level.</p>\n<p><strong>If you were campaigning against Trump, would you even bother? Would it be like LaBradford Smith talking trash to Jordan or something?</strong><br>\nI would’ve enjoyed campaigning against Trump. That would’ve been fun.</p>\n<p><strong>Which leadership style suits your vision of where America should go forward? Biden or Hillary?</strong><br>\n<em>[laughs]</em> Come on, Bill.</p>\n<p><strong>I had to ask you one thing you can’t answer! Here’s one you have to answer: Who’s more untradable, Derrick Rose or Jay Cutler?</strong><br>\n<em>[pause]</em> Oh, I think Rose still has more upside. Remember, Rose is still awfully young.</p>\n<p><strong>So you haven’t given up on Rose?</strong><br>\nI’ve not given up on him. Sadly, I think it’s hard to imagine, after that many injuries, him getting back to his MVP-season performance. But he can still be a top-ten point guard.</p>\n<p><strong>Baseball, football, basketball, all the commissioner jobs open up next year. Which one would you want?</strong><br>\nWell, I’m best suited for basketball. But I cannot believe that the commissioner of football gets paid\n$44 million a year.</p>\n<p><strong>When you said, “I cannot believe…,” I didn’t know where you were going with that. Have you thought about calling <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/roger-goodell-season-from-hell\">Roger Goodell</a> and being like, “What are you <em>doing?</em> Can I help you?” [<em>Obama laughs</em>.] “Can I give you some advice? Want to have dinner?”</strong><br>\nThey’re making a profit, and I think that’s what the owners are most concerned with.</p>\n<p><strong>So you think the owners like having him there?</strong><br>\nYou’re not going to drag me into your fights, man. Come on&#8212;I’ve got enough fights of my own. <em>[laughs]</em> This is between you and Roger.</p>\n<p><strong>Number of cigarettes you’ve smoked in the White House since you got here?</strong><br>\nZero in the last five years. I made a promise that once health care passed, I would never have a cigarette again. And I have not.</p>\n<p><strong>What perk of being president are you going to miss the most?</strong><br>\nSo the clear answer would be Air Force One: an amazing plane with an amazing crew, they clear out airspace so you don’t have to wait. And you land anytime, you leave anytime. But it may be Marine One, because even post presidency, I may be able to round up a private plane sometime, but it’s tough not to have your helicopter waiting for you. <em>[laughs]</em></p>\n<p><strong>The last time I talked to you, you had one teenage daughter.</strong><br>\nNow I have two.</p>\n<p><strong>I’m two years away. Is it better, worse, or the same than what you expected when everybody told you, “Oh, just wait&#8212;just wait till they’re teenagers”?</strong><br>\nMy daughters are amazing girls. They’re smart, they’re funny. They take after their mom, and Michelle’s done a great job with them. You get these teenage moments&#8212;they love you, but what I think really affects you most is they just don’t have time for you. It’s not an active disdain for you. It’s just their calendars start filling up and they’ve got all\nthese friends who are much more interesting.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h2>The 14 Best Photos from the White House Flickr Account</h2>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Yeah, you’re not the coolest person in their lives anymore.</strong><br>\nAnd you just have to let go, you have to acknowledge that if you say to them, “Hey, you want to go watch this movie?” or “Hey, you want to go take a swim at the pool?” “No, sorry, Daddy. I love you, though. See you tomorrow, ’cause I’m spending the night at somebody’s house.” The golden age is between, say, 6, 7, and 12, and they’re your buddies and they just want to hang out. And after that, they will love you, but they don’t have that much time for you. And my understanding is, based on friends of mine who have older kids, is that with a little bit of luck, as long as you’re not so completely annoying during these teenage years, they’ll come back to you around 23, 24, and actually want to hang out with you. But that stretch is painful. The compensation you get for the fact that they don’t have time for you is: Nothing beats watching your children become smarter and cooler than you are. And you suddenly will hear them say something or make a joke or have an insight and you go,\n“Wow. I didn’t think of that.”</p>\n<p><strong>Are they ready for you to be the ex-president?</strong><br>\nNot as much as Michelle, but certainly ready.</p>\n<p><strong>Oh, Michelle’s the leader of the power rankings?</strong><br>\nOh, absolutely. There are clear rankings. Michelle. Malia and Sasha, they’re constantly wrestling for second place. I rank ahead of the dogs.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Bill Simmons</strong> <em>is the founder of Grantland, the co-creator of ESPN’s</em> 30 for 30 <em>sports documentary series, and the best-selling

He couldn’t always harness it. He couldn’t stop trying to win everyone over, whether it was a <em>60 Minutes</em> correspondent, 500 powerful donors in a crowded banquet hall, or a fetching woman on a rope line.\n<p>If Clinton acted like someone who ran Capitol Records, Obama&#8212;both the person <em>and</em> the president&#8212;carries himself like Roger Federer, a merciless competitor who keeps coming and coming, only there’s a serenity about him that\ndisarms just about everyone. At one point during the hour I spent interviewing him at the White House this fall, he casually compared himself to Aaron Rodgers, and he wasn’t bragging. Obama identified with Rodgers’s ability to keep his focus downfield despite all the chaos happening in front of him. That’s Obama’s enduring quality,\nand (to borrow another sports term) this has been his “career year.”</p>\n<p>Obama lives in America’s most famous museum and uses it to his advantage. You’re sitting there in some ancient tearoom waiting for him to show up, surrounded by portraits of former first ladies and framed maps from battles\nthat America won over the centuries. Everyone is friendly but suspicious. Everyone talks in hushed tones. You feel like you’re intruding at all times. You’re just…waiting. Suddenly, ten anonymous security guards pop out of hallways\nand doorways that you didn’t know were there. The energy shifts. And then, there’s Obama&#8212;big smile, big handshake, some ball-busting comments to put everyone at ease. Within seconds of greeting me, he was poking fun at my shoes and teasing me for not writing anymore.</p>\n<p>“It’s really aggravating not having you on Grantland,” he said, almost like I betrayed him. “I go to the site and there’s no Simmons. Come on, man, it’s not the same.”</p>\n<p>It’s an alpha-male trick&#8212;put someone off-balance, flatter them and bust their chops at the same time. A few minutes later, he was grabbing control of the interview with measured responses, knowing that he didn’t have to perform\nwithout cameras or podcast equipment. And so he took his time. And it worked. I mean, how do you interrupt the most powerful man on earth? It felt like the way Federer repeatedly jumped Novak Djokovic’s second serve in the 2015 U.S. Open Final&#8212;a savvy trick to disrupt someone’s flow, a seemingly harmless way to gain an edge. It’s what the great competitors do.</p>\n<p>In January, Obama will begin his eighth and final year on the job. It’s an <em>era</em> now. What has he learned about leadership? What was his biggest regret? Why did it seem like, in 2015, he finally started letting it fly, threw on his Beefsquatch costume and let everyone know “THIS IS ME NOW!” Gay marriage, health care, Charleston, the Iran deal… If you voted against him, 2015 was the year when his inner confidence bothered you more than ever. And if you voted for him, 2015 was definitely the year when you said, “<em>That</em> is the guy I voted for.” But what if Barack Obama has been that guy all along?</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>BILL SIMMONS: If you could go back to 2008 and tell yourself one thing, what would it be?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>BARACK OBAMA:</strong> “You’re going to be busy.” Coming in, we were going through an unprecedented economic upheaval, combined with an upheaval in the Middle East that we hadn’t seen in our lifetimes. There was going\nto be a huge amount of disruption. I would probably tell myself to communicate more effectively early on than I did. We ran a great campaign. It wasn’t as great as it seems in retrospect&#8212;there’s always rose-colored glasses but there’s no doubt that we captured the country’s imagination. And somehow in those first two years, I think a certain arrogance crept in, in the sense of thinking as long as we get the policy ready, we didn’t have to sell it.</p>\n<p>One thing I learned through some tough election cycles: You can’t separate good policy from the need to bring the American people along and make sure that they know why you’re doing what you’re doing. And that’s particularly\ntrue now in this new communications era. I think that we were ahead of the curve in 2008 in social media and the Internet and digital communications. When we came into office, instead of taking some of those lessons, we\nsuddenly adapted ourselves to the White House press room and structures that had been built back in the 1940s and ’50s. As a consequence of those missteps early, we got the policies right, and that’s why the economy now has grown for five and a half straight years, six years, and why unemployment rates have gone from 10 percent to 5.1 percent. But there was a lot of political pain along the way that might not have been necessary.</p>\n<p><strong>Was there a point in those first three years where you started to feel overwhelmed by the job? Where you\nwere just like, “My God, I just had no idea this was going to be this hard!”</strong><br>\nI had a pretty good handle. One thing I learned during the campaign was that I’ve got a good temperament. I don’t get too high and I don’t get too low. I’m able to stay focused even when there’s a lot of stuff going on around me.</p>\n<p><strong>So you’re like Gregg Popovich. Although he does get mad at sideline reporters.</strong><br>\n<em>[laughs]</em> He does. So do I. <em>[laughs]</em> Yeah. Or maybe [Aaron] Rodgers in the pocket, in the sense of you can’t be distracted by what’s around you, you’ve got to be looking downfield. And I think that’s a quality that I have&#8212;not getting flustered in what’s around me. So there was never a point, even early on&#8212;even in the first six months, where we weren’t sure whether we were going to dip into another Great Depression, we weren’t sure whether the steps we were taking on rescuing the auto industry or stabilizing the financial system were going to work&#8212;there weren’t moments where I thought, “Sheesh, feels like we’re in over our head.”</p>\n<p>But what I didn’t fully appreciate, and nobody can appreciate until they’re in the position, is how decentralized power is in this system. When you’re in the seat and you’re seeing the housing market collapse and you are seeing unemployment skyrocketing and you have a sense of what the right thing to do is, then you realize, “Okay, not only do I have to persuade my own party, not only do I have to prevent the other party from blocking what the right thing to do is, but now I can anticipate this lawsuit, this lobbying taking place, and this federal agency that technically is independent, so I can’t tell them what to do. I’ve got the Federal Reserve, and I’m hoping that they do the right thing&#8212;and by the way, since the economy now is global, I’ve got to make sure that the Europeans, the Asians, the Chinese, everybody is on board.” A lot of the work is not just identifying the right policy but now constantly building these ever shifting coalitions to be able to actually implement and execute and get it done.</p>\n<p><strong>You’re out to dinner with your wife and the phone rings. How many of the people in your life are you like, “Uh-oh, I’ve got to take this”?</strong><br>\nMalia and Sasha. <em>[laughs]</em> And maybe my mother-in-law. My national security adviser, Susan Rice, and Denis McDonough, my chief of staff. Those are the only people whose call I would take during a date night with Michelle. But the entire White House is full of people who have enormous responsibilities. You can’t do this by yourself. The principle of team building in the White House is really no different than the principle of team building anywhere, on a sports team or a well-run business. Do they put team ahead of themselves? Do you make sure all the pieces fit together? Because just having the best athletes, if they’re knocking heads and nobody’s doing rebounding and everybody wants the ball, it isn’t always going to work.</p>\n<p><strong>Is it fair to say that in 2015, you’ve been like the second-semester high school senior who got into Yale and now is like, “I’m going out tonight&#8212;I don’t care if I have a test tomorrow”? All of us were kind of waiting for that guy to show up after he got re-elected. What took two years to get there?</strong><br>\nThere’s no doubt that the longer I’m in this job, the more confident I am about the decisions I’m making and more knowledgeable about the responses I can expect. And as a consequence, you end up being looser. There’s not much I have not seen at this point, and I know what to expect, and I can anticipate more than I did before.</p>\n<p>I [also] have a case to make now that was harder to make earlier in my presidency. We had confidence, for example, that the economic decisions that we made to stabilize the financial system and pass Wall Street reform and raise\ntaxes on the wealthiest and pass health care&#8212;that would have a payoff. But because we had been in such a deep hole, we had to be careful about crowing success when people weren’t feeling it. And it wasn’t really until around 2014 where the attitude of the American people was, “The economy’s improving, I’m feeling better.”</p>\n<p><strong>So you feed off that.</strong><br>\nYou can make your case without caveats, which, I think, hampered my ability to communicate confidence and optimism to people. You didn’t want people to feel as if you were getting ahead of yourself. It’s a combination of me feeling looser because I’ve just been in this job a long time and have gone through some tough stretches. Not only do you not look like you have any fear, but you actually <em>don’t</em> have any fear. And I don’t at this point. The bets we made early on have paid off. Some of it does have to do with luck.</p>\n<p>Think about 2013, right after I’d been re-elected: Our goal was to lead with a big push on immigration reform. And then, before the second inauguration has even happened, [the school shooting at] Sandy Hook happens. Which remains, by the way, the worst few days of my presidency. I went up and visited with those families and&#8212;you know, Bill, you’ve still got small kids. These are 6-year-olds, right? And you have 20 of them who’ve been massacred. Right away, our focus had to shift to “Is there a way for us to capture this moment to see if we can get over this incredible hump to try to put in place some common-sense gun-safety rules?” And we knew it was a stretch, just because of the politics of Congress and the NRA. But we had to try.</p>\n<p>And throughout 2013 and 2014, you had a series of events like that&#8212;the Snowden disclosures, Ebola, Ferguson, ISIL, and unaccompanied children coming across the borders&#8212;all sort of stacked up in a row. None of them individually unsolvable, but given the 24/7 news cycle, they just sort of pile up on each other. Even though, in the midst of this, the economy is improving and we are making real progress on education and health care and energy and so forth, political momentum turns sharply against you. And so we’ve had more than our share of stormy seas, but we’ve navigated the ship well.</p>\n<p><strong>When Ferguson happened last year, I was waiting for Obama the Person to come in. But you had to be President Obama. How you handled Charleston this year and Selma&#8212;that was Obama the Person. So what happened with Ferguson? Do you wish you had handled that differently?</strong><br>\nYou know, the challenge of Ferguson and all issues related to police shootings, race, and the criminal-justice system is that in order to actually get something done, you have to build consensus. Expressing simple outrage without\nfollow-up is often counterproductive. In the case of Ferguson, I’m the attorney general’s boss. If I chime in with a strong opinion about what’s happened, not only do I stand to potentially damage subsequent law-enforcement cases, but immediately you get blowback and backlash that may make people less open to listening. What was different in Charleston was the clarity of what happened&#8212;that allowed, I think, everybody to be open to it.</p>\n<p><strong>Did it take time during the presidency to realize what kind of moments those were?</strong><br>\nYes, sometimes it’s feel. Sometimes the circumstances won’t give you a clean statement. The fact that race has always been the fault line of our society and has always distorted our politics&#8212;that is not subject to argument. Part of what you’re looking for is a way not to just vent but to actually move the people. I practiced law for a while&#8212;a lot of times, hard cases can make bad law. If you have an issue that you want to put forward, you’re looking for the right plaintiff and the right court to appear before. I do think as you go on as president, you get a better feel for this, but you’re not always going to be perfect. When the Trayvon Martin case happened, I had an honest response as a father that I think resonated with a lot of people. When Ferguson happened, there was a gap between how quickly we could pull together a police task force, recommendations. And so in that lag, it feels as if I haven’t spoken to the moment as effectively. I suspect that if I were to do it over again, there might be something I could say that would’ve crystallized it more effectively. But Ferguson&#8212;the case itself was tougher because people didn’t know what was going on exactly. In some ways the [Eric] Garner case in New York was clearer because you had on videotape exactly what had happened, and some of the subsequent cases have been more obvious.</p>\n<p>One thing you learn as president is you’re not always going to perform flawlessly and you have to be able to put that out of your mind and then look at the next problem coming down the pipe. If I’m working out in the gym, sometimes I’ll go to NBA Classics and watch some of these old classic games&#8212;</p>\n<p><strong>The lack of HD really hurts&#8212;you can barely see anybody.</strong><br>\nIt’s true&#8212;and the graphics at the bottom are terrible. But a thing that you’re reminded of, watching those old Bulls games, is Jordan had some stinker games in the playoffs. But he would get that out of his mind, and then the next moment comes and he’s right there. He could have a terrible game for the first three quarters and then suddenly go crazy the fourth. Or he might miss a free throw, and then the next play is he’s stealing the ball and hitting the game-winning shot. Part of what I try to do&#8212;not at the level that Jordan did on the basketball court, but part of what you aspire to as president or any of these positions of leadership&#8212;is to try to figure out how to be in the moment, make the best decision you can, know that you’re going to get a bunch of them right, but a bunch of times you’re also not going to get it exactly the way you want it.</p>\n<p><strong>You win the election in 2008, and Twitter is just becoming a thing. Over the course of your presidency, that’s the biggest thing that’s changed. What’s the biggest challenge with all that stuff?</strong><br>\nSpeed. You are on 24/7&#8212;you have to respond immediately. The job of our office, to keep up and to respond quickly to anything that’s happening but not be consumed by it, is completely different. We’ve been building a digital team inside the White House.</p>\n<p><strong>When did that start?</strong><br>\nToo late. That’s an example of something that I would’ve started earlier. That was a lesson that coming out of the first term, I should’ve understood. That’s why we built this team. It’s so interesting watching my daughters. Both are complete ninjas on the phone, right? And they can do things that I don’t even understand&#8212;they’re doing it in two seconds. But I even see a difference between Malia, who’s 17, and Sasha, who’s 14. There’s almost a mini-generational gap in terms of Sasha being so connected seamlessly to this smartphone in a way that Malia, who was already a little bit older when it really started to take, is not.</p>\n<p><strong>The ability to multitask with 19 different friends at the same time…</strong><br>\nYeah. And just the degree to which her social life is so connected to that. So it’s not just having to change how we do business inside the White House to react to stories, but also, how do we tell a story about issues to constituencies that are completely splintered, who don’t watch television in the same way, who don’t watch the news in the same way? In some ways we’re just laying the foundation for what I assume will be the standard practice of future presidents.</p>\n<p><strong>Gun control: You’ve tried to legislate it as much as you possibly could and hit a wall basically in every direction. But the one thing Hillary Clinton has brought up is executive action.</strong><br>\nWell, keep in mind that after Sandy Hook, we put forward 23 executive actions. So we haven’t been asleep at the switch in terms of executive actions that we’ve tried. There are maybe a few more that had to be scrubbed by lawyers because, essentially, with every executive action, we can count on it being challenged by somebody in Congress or, in this case, the NRA. We want to make any executive action we take as defensible as possible legally. In the absence of a movement politically in which people say, “Enough is enough,” we’re going to continue to see, unfortunately, these tragedies take place. The main thing that I’ve been trying to communicate over the last several of these horrific episodes is that, contrary to popular belief, Americans are not more violent than people in other developed countries. But they have more deadly weapons to act out their rage, and that’s the only main variable that you see between the U.S. and these other countries.</p>\n<p><strong>It does feel like it’s going to become the dominant issue of year eight.</strong><br>\nI hope so. We have this weird habit in this culture of mourning and, you know, 48, 72 hours of wall-to-wall coverage, and then…suddenly we move on. And I will do everything I can to make sure that there’s a sustained attention paid to this thing.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s the most entertaining conspiracy theory you ever read about yourself?</strong><br>\nThat military exercises we were doing in Texas were designed to begin martial law so that I could usurp the Constitution and stay in power longer. Anybody who thinks I could get away with telling Michelle I’m going to be president any longer than eight years does not know my wife.</p>\n<p><strong>Have you ever said, “Give me the JFK-assassination files, I want to read them. Give me all the secret stuff”?</strong><br>\nI gotta tell you, it’s a little disappointing. People always ask me about Roswell and the aliens and UFOs, and it turns out the stuff going on that’s top secret isn’t nearly as exciting as you expect. In this day and age, it’s not as top secret as you’d think.</p>\n<p><strong>Would you ever want to be a Supreme Court justice?</strong><br>\n<em>[pauses]</em></p>\n<p><strong>You paused!</strong><br>\nNo&#8212;well, the reason I paused for a second was just to make sure that I let people know that I think good judges are really important, and Supreme Court justices, obviously, are hugely important. I don’t have the temperament to sit in relative solitude and just opine and write from the bench. I want to be in the action a little bit more.</p>\n<p><strong>Is it true you have a virtual driving range in the White House?</strong><br>\nTrue.</p>\n<p><strong>It’s in the bowels of the White House?</strong><br>\nYeah, I mean, this is not like some super-fancy thing. But I can hit these Wiffle balls.</p>\n<p><strong>So you go down there and hit, like as a stress reliever?</strong><br>\nYeah. Just whack ’em. Whack ’em around a little bit.</p>\n<p><strong>Has anyone come to the White House and picked up your older daughter for a date?</strong><br>\nNo, but I’ve seen some folks glancing at her in ways that made me not happy.</p>\n<p><strong>Tell the Secret Service, “Just take out that guy over there”?</strong><br>\n“Just keep an eye on him.”</p>\n<p><strong>Does it scare you that your wife could have a billion-dollar daytime talk show and you could be Stedman 2.0?</strong><br>\n<em>[laughs]</em> Uh…</p>\n<p><strong>Because that’s in play. She could do that if she wanted.</strong><br>\nAnd if that’s what she wants to do, I’m okay with her making a whole lot of money. There’s nothing wrong with that.</p>\n<p><strong>Would you ever want to be part of the ownership for an NBA team?</strong><br>\nAbsolutely.</p>\n<p><strong>Would it have to be the Bulls, or would it have to be somebody else?</strong><br>\nWell, you know, I know [Jerry] Reinsdorf pretty good&#8212;he’s not giving that thing up anytime soon. But I have fantasized about being able to put together a team and how much fun that would be. I think it’d be terrific.</p>\n<p><strong>How many times have you said to your kids, “Stop Googling me”?</strong><br>\nI don’t have to tell them that. They have no interest in me. I mean, they’re hopefully interested in me as a father.</p>\n<p><strong>Not as a public figure. What’s your guiltiest-pleasure TV show? Don’t say <em>Game of Thrones</em>, because that’s a good show.</strong><br>\nProbably the guiltiest pleasure&#8212;and this is kind of lame&#8212;is <em>Big Break</em>. You know, on the Golf Channel? Which is kind of a silly show. <em>[laughs]</em> But I find it really relaxing.</p>\n<p><strong>So you watch it on the treadmill or something?</strong><br>\nYeah, when I’m working out sometimes late at night. I never see all the episodes, but if they’ve got some chipping contest or something… <em>[laughs]</em> It’s pretty lame. I do love <em>Game of Thrones</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Which character do you identify with?</strong><br>\nMy favorite character is probably…the dwarf, what’s his name?</p>\n<p><strong>Oh, yeah. Peter Dinklage’s character.</strong><br>\nThe problem with <em>Game of Thrones,</em> though, is that I don’t remember the names of any of the characters.</p>\n<p><strong>I don’t, either.</strong><br>\nI remember the characters, so when I watch it, I know exactly what’s going on. But if you read a review of the show afterwards and they’re mentioning such and such, the only one I remember is Jon Snow, because I can pronounce Jon Snow.</p>\n<p><strong>Which <em>Game of Thrones</em> character is Donald Trump?</strong><br>\nUh…I don’t think…I don’t think any of them rise to that level.</p>\n<p><strong>If you were campaigning against Trump, would you even bother? Would it be like LaBradford Smith talking trash to Jordan or something?</strong><br>\nI would’ve enjoyed campaigning against Trump. That would’ve been fun.</p>\n<p><strong>Which leadership style suits your vision of where America should go forward? Biden or Hillary?</strong><br>\n<em>[laughs]</em> Come on, Bill.</p>\n<p><strong>I had to ask you one thing you can’t answer! Here’s one you have to answer: Who’s more untradable, Derrick Rose or Jay Cutler?</strong><br>\n<em>[pause]</em> Oh, I think Rose still has more upside. Remember, Rose is still awfully young.</p>\n<p><strong>So you haven’t given up on Rose?</strong><br>\nI’ve not given up on him. Sadly, I think it’s hard to imagine, after that many injuries, him getting back to his MVP-season performance. But he can still be a top-ten point guard.</p>\n<p><strong>Baseball, football, basketball, all the commissioner jobs open up next year. Which one would you want?</strong><br>\nWell, I’m best suited for basketball. But I cannot believe that the commissioner of football gets paid\n$44 million a year.</p>\n<p><strong>When you said, “I cannot believe…,” I didn’t know where you were going with that. Have you thought about calling <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/roger-goodell-season-from-hell\">Roger Goodell</a> and being like, “What are you <em>doing?</em> Can I help you?” [<em>Obama laughs</em>.] “Can I give you some advice? Want to have dinner?”</strong><br>\nThey’re making a profit, and I think that’s what the owners are most concerned with.</p>\n<p><strong>So you think the owners like having him there?</strong><br>\nYou’re not going to drag me into your fights, man. Come on&#8212;I’ve got enough fights of my own. <em>[laughs]</em> This is between you and Roger.</p>\n<p><strong>Number of cigarettes you’ve smoked in the White House since you got here?</strong><br>\nZero in the last five years. I made a promise that once health care passed, I would never have a cigarette again. And I have not.</p>\n<p><strong>What perk of being president are you going to miss the most?</strong><br>\nSo the clear answer would be Air Force One: an amazing plane with an amazing crew, they clear out airspace so you don’t have to wait. And you land anytime, you leave anytime. But it may be Marine One, because even post presidency, I may be able to round up a private plane sometime, but it’s tough not to have your helicopter waiting for you. <em>[laughs]</em></p>\n<p><strong>The last time I talked to you, you had one teenage daughter.</strong><br>\nNow I have two.</p>\n<p><strong>I’m two years away. Is it better, worse, or the same than what you expected when everybody told you, “Oh, just wait&#8212;just wait till they’re teenagers”?</strong><br>\nMy daughters are amazing girls. They’re smart, they’re funny. They take after their mom, and Michelle’s done a great job with them. You get these teenage moments&#8212;they love you, but what I think really affects you most is they just don’t have time for you. It’s not an active disdain for you. It’s just their calendars start filling up and they’ve got all\nthese friends who are much more interesting.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h2>The 14 Best Photos from the White House Flickr Account</h2>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Yeah, you’re not the coolest person in their lives anymore.</strong><br>\nAnd you just have to let go, you have to acknowledge that if you say to them, “Hey, you want to go watch this movie?” or “Hey, you want to go take a swim at the pool?” “No, sorry, Daddy. I love you, though. See you tomorrow, ’cause I’m spending the night at somebody’s house.” The golden age is between, say, 6, 7, and 12, and they’re your buddies and they just want to hang out. And after that, they will love you, but they don’t have that much time for you. And my understanding is, based on friends of mine who have older kids, is that with a little bit of luck, as long as you’re not so completely annoying during these teenage years, they’ll come back to you around 23, 24, and actually want to hang out with you. But that stretch is painful. The compensation you get for the fact that they don’t have time for you is: Nothing beats watching your children become smarter and cooler than you are. And you suddenly will hear them say something or make a joke or have an insight and you go,\n“Wow. I didn’t think of that.”</p>\n<p><strong>Are they ready for you to be the ex-president?</strong><br>\nNot as much as Michelle, but certainly ready.</p>\n<p><strong>Oh, Michelle’s the leader of the power rankings?</strong><br>\nOh, absolutely. There are clear rankings. Michelle. Malia and Sasha, they’re constantly wrestling for second place. I rank ahead of the dogs.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Bill Simmons</strong> <em>is the founder of Grantland, the co-creator of ESPN’s</em> 30 for 30 <em>sports documentary series, and the best-selling author of</em> The Book of Basketball. <em>He is currently creating his own show for HBO, which will premiere next spring.</em></p>","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"channels":[{"id":"59b038ed0a8d2f0976474f19","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Culture","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"culture"}],"franchises":[{"id":"59b038eedd663e6940cf161b","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Men Of The Year","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"men-of-the-year"}],"famous-people":[{"id":"59b038ecdd663e6940cf158f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Bill Simmons","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"bill-simmons"},{"id":"59b038eb7246eb56980ac792","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Barack Obama","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"barack-obama"}],"topics":[{"id":"59b038ecf667492236d9173f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Politics","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"politics"}]},"channel":"News & Culture","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"56424a0aa3bd50211a99bd7c","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","email":"Bill_Simmons@condenast.com","name":"Bill Simmons","socialMedia":[]}]},"dek":"The leader of the free world sits down with the free agent of the year&#8212;HBO’s Bill Simmons&#8212;to discuss the Obama era and beyond.

bus tells you everything you need to know because the bus is a piece of shit. You would expect a Donald Trump campaign bus to be MOST LUXURIOUS, MOST DESIRED, NUMBER ONE BUS in the world, with a solid-gold chassis and marble toilets and a rooftop fuck cabana. This is not that bus. “It’s just a bus,” one Trump staffer told me, which is exactly right. It’s an old cross-country bus that still smells like an old cross-country bus, only it’s painted blue, with the name TRUMP in huge letters across both sides, plus the campaign hashtag <em>#Make America Great Again!</em> Trump says he has copyrighted it (“I’m using that a lot, and I think it’s a great statement”) even though you can’t actually put exclamation points or spaces in a hashtag.\n<p>The bus is basically a rolling version of Trump’s Atlantic City: it’s built to look nice for a single day, then it falls into disrepair the moment you’ve stopped paying attention. From a distance, though, the bus looks like a monument. You see the name, and you take in everything that name connotes&#8212;wealth, ego, poor taste&#8212;and the bus has done its job. This is Trump’s bus, and it dominates the landscape the moment it arrives. People from all around take selfies near it. Why? Because TRUMP, that’s why.</p>\n<p>And the bus is working. Perhaps you’ve noticed&#8212;or perhaps you’re trying not to notice&#8212;but Donald Trump is leading all current Republican candidates in the national polls, and his lead is growing. And so it doesn’t really matter whether you see this as an alarming sign of the nation’s growing lunacy, or as a reckoning for a GOP that has been awash for years in hateful rhetoric, or as a byproduct of Trump’s masterful ability to hijack all political coverage by embracing his role as America’s Master Idiot. He’s doing it. At least for a brief moment, he’s winning. And he may extend his lead once the GOP debates begin Thursday night. Trump has managed to plaster his name all over this election as if it were one of his overpriced condos, and he has drawn the crowds as a result.</p>\n<p>And these are real voters out here who are responding to him: real voters who are lining up for his rallies in large numbers (not as large as Trump claims, but still!), real voters who hang on every word of his ridiculous pitch for how he will wheel and deal America back to the top.</p>\n<p>But who the fuck are these people? Are they blind? Are they crazy? Have they been brainwashed by all the giant signs? Or is it possible they see something in Trump that the rest of us don’t? What makes someone want to seriously consider voting for this man? I didn’t know what the answer was, but I wanted to see for myself. I needed to make it make sense. So I went to Iowa&#8212;Iowa: The State You Grew Up Swearing You’d Leave One Day!™&#8212;to meet them. And to see The Donald in the flesh.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Every election dispatch from Iowa is required to include a bit of scenery-setting, to show you just how folksy Iowa is: corn, state fairs, dragonflies, balloon museums, smiling fat babies, etc.</p>\n<p>This is not the Iowa I visited. The Donald Trump Make America Great Again Rally and Family Picnic was held in Oskaloosa, a small town 60 miles east of Des Moines. Oskaloosa is like a lot of small Midwestern towns right now: crumbling houses, shuttered businesses, half-empty strip malls.  You are surrounded by loss here. One of the few thriving businesses I saw in town, apart from a kickass bar called The Cellar Peanut Pub, was a video store. An actual video store. They didn’t even have to rent porn to stay solvent. They had customers, <em>and</em> they were hiring.</p>\n<p>Oskaloosa has been left behind in the Information Age. What has left here is never coming back, no matter what any politician or businessman promises. And people in Osky&#8212;the locals call it “Osky”&#8212;don’t look pleased about this. Contrary to friendly Midwestern stereotypes, they look PISSED. Every man I saw in town looked like your father-in-law the first time you met him at the door. Out on the empty roads, the only vehicles are big, angry pickup trucks with huge side mirrors sticking way out, like they wanna punch your car. People here are aggrieved. People here have had a lot of disappointment, and they are sick of it.</p>\n<p>Like Karen and Diane. Along with a bunch of friends and family, they showed up early this morning to the 696-seat George Daily Community Auditorium (which Oskaloosa’s middle school and high school share) so they could get as close to their billionaire savior as possible. To “see the color of his eyes,” Diane said. I greeted their group as they waited by the door, many of them sitting in nylon golf chairs, nervous about losing their spot in line.</p>\n<p>“I like that Trump won’t back down,” Karen told me. “He says what he means and he means what he’s saying. He ain’t going to say he’s sorry. Sometimes he likes to say things not politically correct, but they all better get used to that. The people who do speak politically correct have been losers.”</p>\n<p>“They constipated America!” Diane said, rocking a House of Blues t-shirt. “What we have had is politicians and lawyers who have constipated America. Let’s get a businessman in there and get things moving! We need our new MiraLAX!”</p>\n<p><em>Do you believe everything Trump says?</em></p>\n<p>“At this point, I’m inclined to say he’s not lying.”</p>\n<p><em>Do you think he exaggerates sometimes?</em></p>\n<p>“Oh yeah. Who doesn’t?”</p>\n<p>“He is for America,” Karen says. “He is for the elderly. He is for the quiet people.”</p>\n<p>Who are “<em>the quiet people</em>”?</p>\n<p>“The people like us, that a lot of times walk around with the attitude that, ‘Oh, it doesn’t matter what I think. I’m just from Osky.’ You know? <em>The quiet people</em>. The people who don’t think they have a voice.”</p>\n<p>Karen used to live in Arizona, where she had a job at a semiconductor plant, adding gold buttons to each chip in on anassembly line. But the plant was relocated to China, and so she lost her job and relocated here. As you could probably surmise, she likes Trump’s tough talk about foreigners stealing our jobs. I had arrived in Iowa just as Trump was doubling down on his comments that Mexico was sending “rapists” across our border; people here loved it, and seemed oddly emotional about the subject of immigration, even though Iowa is nowhere near the border. Apparently, it’s not just the immigrants from <em>Mexico</em> that concern Iowans for Trump. “We need to get the Muslims out of the country,” a man named Bob with a swirling white beard told me, “before they start killing our families!” Everyone around him nodded.</p>\n<p>The line to see Trump grew longer and stretched across the front of Oskaloosa middle school. A local Hy-Vee supermarket put up picnic tables and gave away bottled water, potato salad, pulled pork, and hot dogs thick as flashlights. Elderly people tooted around on Rascal scooters. An enterprising man hocked all-purpose GOP fanboy buttons with slogans like BENGHAZI MATTERS.</p>\n<p>I met an old couple wearing matching Trump t-shirts, which they told me they wore every day. “I haven’t had one bad comment on it,” said the wife. I met a man named Wayne who voted for Obama twice but was now firmly in Trump’s corner. I met ANOTHER man named Wayne who walked me carefully through his five-point rationale for why Trump was the best candidate. (Voters often show up at these rallies with little stump speeches of their own.) I met a woman named Jill who showed up with several hand-drawn signs. (My favorite was “Beltway Talks; Trump Works.”) Jill was <em>fired the fuck up</em> for some Trump in her life. I don’t know how it’s possible to be so fired up with the election so far away, but Jill was <em>blazing</em>. She wanted to make sure the whole world knew that Trump and his voters were for real.</p>\n<p>“I was terribly insulted when [John McCain] called us crazies,” Jill told me.</p>\n<p><em>What is it that you like so much about Trump?</em></p>\n<p>“He’s a capitalist,” Jill explained. “That inspires me.”</p>\n<p>I also ran into a very rare minority in the crowd&#8212;a Pakistani woman who emigrated here from Pakistan 40 years ago and didn’t like the idea of anyone skirting the naturalization process.</p>\n<p>“I came in the right way,” she told me. “When you try to do things the right way, it doesn’t work. And all these illegals sneaking in, and being able to stay&#8212;how do they get to do that?”</p>\n<p><em>And you think Trump will make things fairer</em>.</p>\n<p>“Well, as long as he does a better job than what’s being done. You know?”</p>\n<p>A nervous drug counselor named Tracy was also in line to see Trump. Unlike some of the others, she had some concerns about him. Well, one: “He’s an atheist,” she said.</p>\n<p>A man nearby overheard us talking and told us he shared her worry. “We have to elect godly men.”</p>\n<p>But Jill&#8212;the sign lady&#8212;cut into the conversation and came to the rescue: “He’s not an atheist. I wanted to correct that. He explained the church he’s gone to his whole life. He didn’t articulate it as well as he should have. But you know what? That articulation&#8212;I’m not concerned with that.”</p>\n<p>That seemed to cool Tracy’s hangups about Trump being a godless heathen.</p>\n<p>And I spotted a woman pushing around a stroller with a photograph of a live abortion taped to it, along with a big sign that read “DEAR PLANNED PARENTHOOD, I AM NOT FOR SALE.” For some reason, the woman ditched the stroller in the middle of the path leading to the auditorium, and a squat veteran named Randy went to alert the police. “That’s a good way to get a bomb brought in,” he said. While we all stared at the stroller, looking for any suspicious bulges (it turned out to be clean), Randy explained to me why he had a big ol’ Trump-on.</p>\n<p>“I like what he has to say. He won’t take no shit from nobody.”</p>\n<p><em>What’s your favorite thing he’s said?</em></p>\n<p>“You’re fired!”</p>\n<p><em>Who would you like him to fire, besides Obama?</em></p>\n<p>“Let’s see: John Kerry, our last governor, the attorney general, every Muslim that they put in…”</p>\n<p>Randy seemed untroubled by Trump’s lack of polish, or knowledge, or basic human grace. Far from it&#8212;these were virtues. “You don’t have to be a brain to run a business,” Randy said. “Just an ass. Sometimes you can be nice and polite, but there’s sometimes you’ve just got to be a horse’s ass with somebody to get them to do what they’re supposed to be doing.”</p>\n<p>So far, I’d heard Trump compared&#8212;favorably&#8212;to a horse’s ass and to a laxative, and I began to imagine a Trump campaign poster that was just a big horse’s butthole spewing hot diarrhea.</p>\n<p><em>So you believe Trump has the fearlessness to run this country?</em></p>\n<p>“I know he does,” said Randy. “Have you ever watched <em>The Apprentice?</em>”</p>\n<p>I talked to more voters and a pattern emerged in the answers. Trump was “honest,” “not PC,” “authentic,” “shooting from the hip,” and “called a spade a spade.” And of course, he wasn’t from Washington. He was gonna get in there and shake things up.</p>\n<p>We’ve heard all of this before, from many, many other candidates. Every presidential election has at least one magical, imaginary OUTSIDER&#8212;that teenage wet dream of a president who rides into Washington, tells those bureaucrats what shitheads they are, and bulldozes Congress into doing cool shit simply with the power of his huge cock. I have fallen for this kind of candidate. YOU have fallen for this kind of candidate. Everybody wants this mythical Bulworth to exist, but at this level of politics, there are no outsiders, and the game changes its rules for no one.</p>\n<p>And yet, people buy in. Maybe this time, they think, the guy who says he’s different really is different.</p>\n<p>And Trump, to his credit, is definitely different.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Noon was approaching and the doors to the auditorium opened. Trump supporters poured into seats in front of the stage and onto a set of risers behind the podium. The hated media&#8212;that would include me&#8212;sat toward the back.</p>\n<p>After a couple of introductory speeches from a local politician and a member of Seal Team Seven (not Six, but Seven&#8212;they’re one better!), we were greeted by former <em>Apprentice</em> runner-up Tana Goertz, who also happens to be Trump 2016’s Iowa co-chair and a “well-known Bedazzler spokeswoman.”</p>\n<p>“We all know how much Donald Trump is worth!” Goertz cried out, inaccurately. “How much?” The response from the crowd was messy and overlapping&#8212;many wild guesses called out at once.</p>\n<p>“I’ve met a lot of smart people,” Goertz continued, undaunted, “but I have never met a man that thinks about working when other people are talking about working.”</p>\n<p><em>Wait, what?</em></p>\n<p>“At the heart of it all, he’s a builder. Who better than Donald Trump to rebuild this country?”</p>\n<p>Okay, that’s a metaphor I can get behind.</p>\n<p>“You have never ever in your life experienced what you’re about to experience today. I’m just going to say: Sit back, put on your seatbelt. It’s going to be a fun ride. You will enjoy the experience and the ride, which is Donald Trump.”</p>\n<p>Finally&#8212;after a quick Pledge of Allegiance&#8212;the man himself emerged through a side door, carried aloft by the strains of Joe Esposito’s “You’re The Best.”</p>\n<p>I saw the hair first. It arrived in two parts: first the Turtle Wax-ed strands that run along both sides of his scalp, then the champagne glitter yarn kit perched top. I’d never seen Trump before, and the hair was all that I’d hoped for, and more. And after announcing his intention to molest all of Iowa’s chief export (“I want to grab that corn like you’ve never seen&#8212;so beautiful”) the ride started up.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>I’m gonna say a few nice things about Donald Trump now. If that terrifies you, then by all means, skim through this section and carry on with your existence.</p>\n<p>But I must tell you that, in person, Donald Trump is a very entertaining public speaker. And is this really such a surprise? Ever since* The Art of the Deal*, Trump has spent decades giving speeches all over the country, acting as our Get-Rich-Quick godfather. When he gets in front of a microphone, he requires no notes. No teleprompter. He is confident. He is casual. He is charming. Everyone is a “great guy” or an “amazing negotiator.”</p>\n<p>He can even be funny. When I texted a friend from the event that Trump was hilarious in person, he texted back, “NO. No no no.” Sorry, it’s true. It’s still not clear whether he’s in on the joke&#8212;there’s always been a bit of mystery to how aware Donald Trump is that Donald Trump is full of shit. But when you see him in person, and you hear him claim that the term “Supreme Leader” would be more fitting for him than for the head of Iran, there is the tiniest hint that he knows what a ludicrous thing this is to say. Even his exaggerations are hilarious. He said this was the biggest crowd in state history, even though we were in a public-school auditorium. He said he was worth more than $10 billion, a figure that is impossible for him to prove but also impossible for us to disprove. He said he made $213 million from <em>The Apprentice</em>, a figure which NBC steadfastly refutes.</p>\n<p>At one point, Trump boasted about how much veterans adore him. To prove it, he trotted out a gorgeous brunette who was carrying a perfect stack of white paper topped with a bow. I swear it looked like an unwrapped package of blank Hammermill printer paper. “In one day,” Trump blared, “many hundreds of letters from Vietnam vets, thanking me. This is from veterans. Each page, a different letter. It’s amazing.”</p>\n<p>Everyone ate it up. They laughed and cheered and hollered out in approval all through his speech.  It was more like a late-night monologue, and true to his reputation, Trump is not careful with his words. You can see why people think he’s more “honest” than one of the other randos in the GOP field&#8212;he’s gifted at not sounding like a politician even as he deploys standard tricks from the “I’m not a politician” handbook. He is definitely more fun to watch than Bobby Jindal. I wish there were more Trump-like candidates out there who are not Donald Trump, if that makes any sense.</p>\n<p>He also made a good point or two in between all the noise. At one point he bellowed: “I read Jeb Bush raised over a hundred million dollars. Now if you think that those people giving him all those money aren’t getting a lot, you’re wrong. All of these people are controlled by the people who gave them their money.” He’s right! It’s true! Holy shit, Donald Trump said a true thing. I heard it with my own two ears.</p>\n<p>If Donald Trump has one undeniable virtue as a politician, it’s that he does not try to fake being one of us. He’s not going to the fucking Bowl-o-Rama on a Saturday night in a plaid shirt to prove he’s a man of the people. The whole thrust of The Donald’s campaign is that he is special. He is extraordinary. In Osky, he compared his business acumen to Jack Nicklaus’ golfing ability and Babe Ruth’s hitting ability. (“It’s called talent. <em>Talent</em>.”) He is a WINNER, and he is here to help this nation of sad losers learn how to win again.</p>\n<p>“We don’t win anymore in this country,” he told the crowd. “When was the last time we won? When did we beat China in a deal? We don’t win.”</p>\n<p>Well, Trump is here to fix all that losing. And here is where my brief jag of mildly effusive praise for Donald Trump must come to an end, because the grim undercurrent of his rise is SHAME.  After all, if you believe we must make America great again, then you must also believe that America, at the present moment, sucks. And pretty much everyone at the Trump picnic believed that America sucks. When I asked a group of Trump supporters outside if they were proud of America, they all laughed with derision. <em>Of course</em> they weren’t proud of America. Of course this nation is a shithole. One voter named Corey told me he hoped Trump would help America “get back to the way it was,” a refrain I heard from a lot of people, as if the country was a rock band that had changed its sound. Backing Trump means acknowledging that you live in a world of failure, and that your last best hope is the Music Man moseying into town.</p>\n<p>Now, here is how Donald Trump says he will Make America Great Again™. In Trump’s worldview, politics is little more than series of deals to be made. Every complex global problem, or intractable adversary, can be tamed with sufficiently hard-ass steakhouse dealmaking. He explained it all in Osky:</p>\n<p>“I know the greatest negotiators in the world,” he said. “Now some of these people are horrible human beings. You wouldn’t have them to dinner. They’re vicious. They’re crude. They’re unhappy. They treat everybody badly. Who cares? I want them negotiating against China. Think of Carl Icahn, a friend of mine. He’d be great. I’d say, ‘Carl, take China’.”</p>\n<p>Now, people applauded this, which alarmed me because (A) Who has friends like this? And (B) Sending a vicious, crude, unhappy person who treats everyone badly to go yell FUCK YOU at the Chinese strikes me as unwise.</p>\n<p>But Trump is so certain, so supremely confident, that everyone at his rallies go for the idea anyway. It comes off as an act of counterintuitive genius. What’s not to like about the idea that you can fix everything by just marching into Washington and yelling at all the dummies to stop being dummies? I wish politics were that simple. I really do. Politics <em>should</em> be that simple. Trump’s gift is that he really can make it sound that easy, even when it’s all a huge lie. His swagger is <em>your</em> swagger. He can reduce entire countries down to a cardboard persona. He’ll get tough with Mexico. He’ll have Carl take China. The way Trump explains it, you’d think China had only one person in it.</p>\n<p>Trump is so certain of his horseshit that, on that stage in Osky, he laid out a remarkable future scenario of him in the Oval Office that was essentially one enormous lie that hasn’t had the chance to become a lie yet. Here now is what President Trump would do if Ford tried to build a manufacturing plant down in Mexico:</p>\n<p>“It’s so easy. <em>It’s too easy</em>. I do it with a phone call. I call the head of Ford, and I say, ‘Every single car and truck that comes into the US, we’re going to tax you 35 percent’.”</p>\n<p>Massive applause! Trump wasn’t done.</p>\n<p>“So this isn’t 99.9 percent&#8212;this is <em>one hundred percent</em> what’s going to happen: He’ll call me back, probably that afternoon, but he may play it tough and call me back the next day. The next day I’ll get a call from Ben Ford”&#8212;NOTE: there is no Ben Ford; I assume he meant Bill&#8212;“and he’ll say, ‘Mr. President, we decided not to build that plant. We’ll build it in the United States.’”</p>\n<p>And everyone in the joint bought it! They damn near broke their hands clapping for this idea! I almost bought it myself! At least, I did for half a second before I thought, <em>Wait, don’t you need Congress to approve shit like that? And wouldn’t forcing the plant to be built here increase the cost of Fords? And then wouldn’t people stop buying Fords? And then wouldn’t Ford go belly up, costing us even MORE jobs than if we had just left the goddamn plant in Mexico? And what about the many, many Fords that are already produced in Mexico?</em></p>\n<p>But a Trump rally isn’t about thinking more than half a second ahead. There is a first BOLD step, and then you are left to assume that everything else will fall neatly into place. In Trump’s white-trash, Louis XIV universe, all you see is the pretty gold paint before it starts chipping off the walls.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Money, ironically, is what will likely wind up being Trump’s political downfall. Once the primary field has been winnowed down to a few schlubs, the GOP establishment will dump its funds into a single candidate with the goal of overtaking Trump, whom they all despise. (Yet one more reason why voters here love him, by the way.) And as rich Trump may claim to be, there are limits to how much of his personal fortune he’ll spend on this effort.</p>\n<p>Once the GOP muscles him out, Trump may very well run a third-party campaign that divides conservative voters and all but hands the 2016 election to a waiting Hillary Clinton. In Osky, this was every thinking Trump voter’s nightmare scenario. “As long as he doesn’t split parties, I’m there,” one attendee told me. “If he does that, it’s too important of an election.” But it could happen. And if it does, Trump may go from the darling of far-right conservatives voters to their most-hated nemesis.</p>\n<p>At the end of Trump’s speech, “We’re Not Gonna Take It” by Twisted Sister boomed through the speakers and played him off the stage.  The crowd grave him a standing O on his way out. The ride was over. The reviews outside were glowing: “Awesome.” “I loved his demeanor.” “Solutions.” “It’s nice to hear somebody talk who’s not a politician.” They were all sold. They were all going to home to preach the gospel of their King Midas.</p>\n<p>As I watched everyone file out, I thought of a moment during Tana Goertz’s opening-act speech earlier in the day, when she pleaded with everyone to eat more of the food outside. “Mr. Trump can’t take all this food home on the plane,” she told us. “There’s not enough room.” And so as all of Trump’s energized constituents filed out of the joint, I pictured him getting onto his plane, cigar in the corner of his mouth, jetting back to the Land of Winners. And I pictured everyone else stuck back here in Osky, with nothing but the scraps he left behind for all the quiet people.</p>","categories":{"channels":[{"id":"59b038ed0a8d2f0976474f19","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Culture","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"culture"}],"famous-people":[{"id":"59b038eddd663e6940cf1605","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"}],"topics":[{"id":"59b038ed7246eb56980ac830","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Election","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"election"},{"id":"59b038ecf667492236d9173f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Politics","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"politics"}]},"channel":"News & Culture","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"558285b9e52bc4b477a968a5","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","name":"Drew Magary","socialMedia":[{"network":"Twitter","handle":"@drewmagary"}]}]},"dek":"America is constipated, says one Trump supporter&#8212;and The Donald?

And how much longer can she last?","embeds":{"571e962846f014b90abc2937":{"id":"571e962846f014b90abc2937","modelName":"article","collection":"articles","body":"<div class=\"embed callout-embed-component dropcap \" data-type=\"callout\"><p>It wasn’t always this way. Once upon a time, a man could marry his Slovenian sweetheart, invite Bill and Hillary Clinton to the lavish wedding, and only the society pages would bother with it. “It was completely different than it is now,” Melania Trump tells me, recalling those bygone days of sanity, speaking in her now famous accent, a kind of dreamy Transylvanian.</p>\n</div><p>Back then, in 2005, it didn’t seem odd that she and Donald Trump would mark their happy occasion with the former president and First Lady, then a senator from New York. “When they went to our wedding, we were private citizens,” Melania reminds me. Just two private citizens getting hitched at the groom’s 126-room Florida palace. He in a tux; she in a $100,000 Dior dress that laborers’ hands had toiled upon for a legendary 550 hours, affixing 1,500 crystals&#8212;jewels fit for private citizens like them. A pair of ordinary people, really, uniting in matrimony in the presence of Rudy Giuliani and Kelly Ripa, as Billy Joel serenaded the couple and guests slurped caviar and Cristal in the shadow of a five-foot-tall Grand Marnier wedding cake.</p>\n<p>Those were, in some ways, simpler times. But things change quickly&#8212;which is perhaps the enduring fact of Melania Trump’s entire improbable life&#8212;and when your husband works up a plan to make America great again, the very same Clintons you once smiled with on your wedding day can now become your family’s mortal enemies. And you can think, as Melania Trump says she does, that it’s no huge deal, really. “This is it, what it is,” Melania tells me. “It’s all business now; it’s nothing personal.”</p>\n<p>Of course, Melania had the foresight to imagine that politics would bring chaos. Donald’s first wife, Ivana, may have wanted Trump to be president, but Melania, his third, was never hot on the idea. “When we discussed about it, I said he really needs to make sure he knows he really wants to do it, because life changes,” Melania says.</p>\n<div class=\"embed callout-embed-component inset-right \" data-type=\"callout\"><div class=\"embed pullquote \" data-type=\"pullquote\"><span class=\"pullquote-content\"><blockquote>\n<p>“I didn’t know much about Donald Trump,” she says of being introduced. “I had my life, I had my world.”</p>\n</blockquote></span></div></div><p>We’re speaking on the phone, though I have no idea where she’s calling from. Is she in her penthouse, a gilded triplex in the Trump Tower? Perhaps somewhere out on the campaign trail? While she’s a crowd-pleaser on the stump, she appears infrequently and only when she deigns to. “Nobody controls me. I travel with my husband when I can,” she says, “when I know that I can go, and I know that my son is okay alone for a few days with the help.”</p>\n<p>While Donald often says that Melania would make a stellar First Lady, the former model offers little clue about what a move to the White House would mean for her. She once said she would be “traditional,” like Jackie Kennedy, and on the question of what causes she might support, she has noted she is already involved in “many, many charities.” She elaborated: “Many different charities involving children, involving many different diseases.”</p>\n<p>In this respect, she is just like her husband. She’s alluringly opaque. She makes meaningful eye contact and emphatically repeats affirmative, folksy banalities&#8212;she “has a thick skin,” she takes things “day by day,” she follows the news “from A to Z”&#8212;until the interviewer either is transported into a supra-verbal understanding or decides it’s pointless to press for specifics. But unlike her husband, Melania is reserved, polite, and steady, say those close to her. “There is a peace in her,” one old friend from Slovenia tells me. She is a homebody. She’s rich, but not a socialite; she prefers family to the It set and retires early after events.</p>\n<p>This image of a retiring homebody, of course, is not the one that Trump’s enemies present when they conjure her in the White House. Ahead of Utah’s primary, allies of Ted Cruz posted a photo from a shoot for a 2000 issue of British <em>GQ</em> in which a naked Melania is lying on her stomach on a white bearskin rug. “Meet Melania Trump. Your next First Lady,” read the ad, aimed at conservative Mormon voters. “Or, you could support Ted Cruz on Tuesday.”</p>\n<p>Trump shot back in a cryptic, menacing message that he would “spill the beans” on Heidi Cruz and then re-tweeted two photos, side by side: one, a mid-sentence Heidi, looking like a gargoyle; another, a bronzed, blue-eyed Melania, looking like a fox. “The images are worth a thousand words,” the caption read, though Trump’s tweet itself was really communicating only four: “My wife is hotter.”</p>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"embed callout-embed-component dropcap \" data-type=\"callout\"><p>It’s easy to think America has changed a lot since Hillary Rodham Clinton was chastised in the early ’90s for her ambition as First Lady&#8212;refusing to sit at home and make cookies. But our conception of a presidential spouse hasn’t evolved much. Michelle Obama, a Princeton graduate and legal hotshot who was once her husband’s law-school-era mentor, has been mainly confined to dealing with soft issues: childhood obesity, planting vegetables. Rather than Hillary or Michelle, it was Laura Bush&#8212;a teacher who supported her husband’s turning from bottle to Bible&#8212;who seemed most suited to Middle America’s idea (or at least a man’s idea) of a First Lady. Of course, the paragon of them all is still Jackie Kennedy, endlessly glamorous and endlessly tolerant of her husband’s philandering.</p>\n</div><p>Those who know Melania say the Jackie template isn’t a bad one for her to aspire to. “She’d be great at picking out the china patterns; she’d be a classic First Lady,” says stylist Phillip Bloch, who has worked with both of the Trumps and attended fashion shows with Melania. But unlike Jackie, who met John Kennedy when he was already a congressman, Melania wasn’t signing on to be a political spouse when she met the notorious Donald Trump in 1998.</p>\n<p>Melania had signed up for a life of conspicuous conspicuousness, one she dutifully chronicled on Instagram and Twitter up until about a year ago, when her social-media accounts&#8212;unlike those of her husband&#8212;went silent with Trump’s entrance into the race. There was Melania in a white robe, working with her “glam team” of stylists, perched on a gilded throne, overlooking Central Park. Here she was, head to toe in white, posing on the Trump jet. There she was, relaxing at “#home #NYC” on a Thursday night, in a room that looked like a fevered baroque dream. In one of her last posts&#8212;right before somebody deemed it advisable to slam shut this opulent little window on her life&#8212;she snapped a parting selfie in a gold-mirrored bathroom. “Bye! I’m off to my #summer residence.”</p>\n<p>While Melania enjoys the services of a chef and an assistant, there’s no nanny raising their son, Barron. That’s the mother’s duty. “We know our roles,” Melania once told Parenting.com, referring to the division of labor with her husband. “I didn’t want him to change the diapers or put Barron to bed.” The boy she calls “little Donald” wants one day to be a “businessman and golfer” and, as she told the publication, almost always dresses in suits. “He’s not a sweatpants child,” she’s said.</p>\n<p>Melania is as fastidious a wife as she is a mother, which Donald appreciates. Things come easy with her. “I work very hard from early in the morning till late in the evening,” Donald told Larry King in 2005. “I don’t want to go home and work at a relationship.” To the twice-divorced Donald, Melania is terrific. He’s never heard her fart or make doodie, as he once told Howard Stern. (Melania has said the key to the success of her marriage is separate bathrooms.) He can trust her to take her birth control every day, he boasted to Stern; she’s just amazing that way. She has the perfect proportions&#8212;five feet eleven, 125 pounds&#8212;and great boobs, which is no trivial matter. Stern once asked Trump what he would do if Melania were in a terrible car accident, God forbid, and lost the use of her left arm, developed an oozing red splotch near her eye, and mangled her left foot. Would Donald stay with her?</p>\n<p>“How do the breasts look?” Trump asked.</p>\n<p>“The breasts are okay,” Stern replied. Then, yeah, of course Trump stays. “Because that’s important.” There are other pluses. He appreciates Melania’s restraint when it comes to Shopping While Trump. “She’s never taken advantage of that situation, okay, as many women would have, frankly,” he has said. (“I prefer quality over quantity,” Melania tells me.) Donald does his part to make things work, too. “He is a very understanding husband,” Melania once told an interviewer. “If I say, ‘I need an hour, I’m going to take a bath,’ or I’m having a massage, he doesn’t have nothing against it. He’s very supportive in that way.” She lets him have his space; she’s not “needy” or “nagging,” as she tells me.</p>\n<p>As for passions beyond the familial, there are a few. Melania dabbles in design. Her line of affordable gem-spangled jewelry and watches, launched on QVC, reportedly sold out in 45 minutes during its initial broadcast. (Melania’s caviar-infused anti-aging creams haven’t sold as well, though a federal judge ruled in her favor in a lawsuit she filed against its promoters.)</p>\n<p>When she was getting her jewelry plans off the ground, Melania sketched the designs for the collection herself, relying on a talent for drawing that her childhood friends tell me she flashed as a girl. “It’s not free; it’s precise,” Petra Sedej, one of Melania’s high school classmates, says of her art. “She has a really good feeling for this.” Another old friend whom I met in Slovenia, and who asked not to be named, sums up Melania’s talents more generally: “People say she’s smart, she’s well-educated like Jackie Kennedy, but…” The friend pauses to find the right words. “She’s smart for the things she’s interested in, like jewelry. She’s not stupid, she’s not a bimbo, but she’s not especially clever.”</p>\n<p>To Melania’s traditional way of thinking, Trump’s aspirations for the White House have little to do with her. The same can be said for his more controversial positions, like his general disdain for immigrants, even though his wife became an American only in 2006. “I chose not to go into politics and policy,” she tells me. “Those policies are my husband’s job.” She has opinions, she assures me, and shares them with Trump. “Nobody knows and nobody will ever know,” she says of the advice she provides him. “Because that’s between me and my husband.”</p>\n<p>The approach is in keeping with her view of her wifely functions. “She stays in her lane,” Bloch says. “When asked, she gives her opinion, but otherwise she stays out of it.”</p>\n<p>Vladimira Tomšič, who went to the same school as Melania and is friendly with her parents, tells me that her upbringing helps explain her marriage. “The secret of why he’s with her,” she explains, “is her traditional values and the importance of family to her.” In other words, that bearskin-rug photo is a red herring: Melania is the ideal wife for the conservative base. She is, in fact, positively biblical&#8212;Trump’s perfect “help meet,” his “suitable helper,” as the Bible’s description of Eve would have it. Melania Trump is as tailored to The Donald as if a divine plastic surgeon had sculpted her out of his rib.</p>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"embed callout-embed-component dropcap \" data-type=\"callout\"><p>When he first met Melania&#8212;at a party during New York Fashion Week in the fall of 1998&#8212;Donald Trump was 52. He was brash and brassy, fabulously wealthy, the stuff of New York legend. Melania Knauss was 28, a tall, shy brunette whose face had yet to acquire the taut, plasticine squint that makes it look as if cameras are forever catching her a second before a sneeze. “I didn’t know much about Donald Trump,” she says of that introduction. “I had my life, I had my world. I didn’t follow Donald Trump and what kind of life he had.”</p>\n</div><p>Years earlier, while modeling in Milan and Paris, Melania had Germanized her last name from <em>Knavs,</em> changing the <em>v</em> to a <em>u</em> and adding an extra <em>s.</em> She had done very well in Europe, but not supermodel well, and hoped to advance her career in the U.S. Paolo Zampolli, a wealthy Italian whose business interests in New York are broad and vague, brought Melania over on a modeling contract and a work visa. Sometimes, in order to promote his models, he would send a few girls to an event and invite photographers, producers, and rich playboys. That night in September 1998, Zampolli had invited Trump, who arrived with a date but was immediately taken with Melania. He sent his companion to the bathroom so he could have a few minutes to chat up the model he’d noticed. But Melania knew of Trump’s reputation&#8212;which was immediately confirmed by the fact that he had come to the party with a date and was now asking for her number.</p>\n<p>She refused, and instead asked Trump for <em>his</em> contact information. Unimpressed with merely catching the eye of the famous billionaire, Melania was studying the situation as if testing a coin with her teeth. “If I give him my number, I’m just one of the women he calls,” she remembers. Melania was curious to see if he’d proffer a business number. “I wanted to see what his intention is,” she explains. “It tells you a lot from the man what kind of number he gives you. He gave me all of his numbers.”</p>\n<p>Perhaps Trump saw something worth admiring in Melania’s willingness to walk away from the deal. Indeed, she waited a week before calling him. “I’m not starstruck,” she explains. “We had a great connection, we had great chemistry, but I was not starstruck. And maybe he noticed that.”</p>\n<p>Soon after Melania and Donald started dating, she apparently broke it off. “She had some trust issues with him at the beginning,” says Matthew Atanian, a photographer who had been Melania’s roommate at Zeckendorf Towers in Union Square when she first moved to New York. “She was telling me that she wouldn’t have it, he was back to his old ways. She kept her apartment to have her own space because of this.”</p>\n<p>Within six months, Atanian says, they were back together. Either she set Donald straight&#8212;he has insisted that his fidelity to Melania is absolute&#8212;or she made her peace with the immutable character of The Donald, telling every interviewer who asks that she doesn’t seek to change him. What she has found in Trump&#8212;despite the age difference and behavior that would make most women run&#8212;is apparently what she was always looking for. “It’s about all that power and protection,” one of Melania’s old friends from Ljubljana tells me. “I think she needed a strong man, a father figure.”</p>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"embed callout-embed-component dropcap \" data-type=\"callout\"><p>In Slovenia these days, there is a certain sense of resentment that Melania has forgotten her roots; there is talk that she refuses to speak Slovenian, that Donald visited the country only once and only long enough to have dinner. There’s a sneaking suspicion that she thinks Slovenia is not good enough for her, and that she might be right. But in interviews, Melania doesn’t shy away from her Slovenian life; she’s not embarrassed by it. “I love my childhood,” she tells me. “It was a beautiful childhood.” Her son speaks Slovenian fluently&#8212;he uses it to speak with his grandparents, who have immigrated to New York and live near them in Trump Tower&#8212;but for Melania, Slovenia represents a relatively short and distant period of her past that she quickly outgrew.</p>\n</div><p>Sevnica, the small railroad town where she was born Melanija Knavs in 1970, is about an hour’s drive from the Slovenian capital. In contrast to the privations that so many suffered in Communist times, the Knavses lived well. Melania’s mother, Amalija Ulčnik, worked developing patterns at a factory that manufactured children’s clothing. She had met Viktor Knavs in 1966 while he was the chauffeur for a nearby town’s mayor.</p>\n<p>Even in those days, when Slovenia was part of Communist Yugoslavia and times were lean, Amalija was always impeccably dressed and perfectly coiffed. “She was very pretty,” says Tomšič, who now runs a local hospital to which Melania donated $25,000 after marrying Donald. “She was always very fancy.” Amalija spent evenings after work sewing clothing for herself and her two daughters, Ines and Melania. Once she learned to draw, Melania sketched her own designs, and her mother or sister sewed them. Melania also made her own jewelry. “Melania never wore anything from the store,” recalls one friend.</p>\n<p>The family struck a worldly image, too, vacationing in France, Italy, and Germany. Every room of their apartment in Sevnica was painted a deep, lush color&#8212;blue in the living room, red in the kitchen, yellow in Melania’s room. Amalija, who got to travel to France and Germany for work, returned with colorful paints for the home, a rarity in Yugoslavia. She also came back from business trips with Western fashion magazines, which Melania’s friends watched her flip through constantly. “They had more than the others,” remembers Melania’s childhood friend Mirjana Jelančič. (She is now the principal of the school she attended with Melania, where there is talk of installing a permanent exhibit on Mrs. Trump, the school’s most famous graduate.)</p>\n<p>Jelančič remembers Melania’s father, Viktor, spending every Saturday lovingly washing his antique Mercedes, another rarity. “It was like a ritual,” Jelančič tells me. After leaving his job working for the mayor of Hrastnik, Viktor, then a member of the Slovenian Communist Party, became a salesman at a state-owned car company. Police files from the time indicate Viktor aroused suspicion for illicit trade and tax evasion in 1976. (He was charged with a tax offense, though his record was later cleared on account of Slovenia’s statute of limitations, a process the courts described to me as “legal rehabilitations.”) Melania blocked my efforts to speak to Viktor, and she denies that any such investigation took place. “He was never under any investigation, he was never in trouble,” she snaps. “We have a clean past. I don’t have nothing to hide.”</p>\n<p>While working for the car company in Ljubljana, Viktor had an apartment there, in one of the city’s first residential high-rises. It was a prestigious address and provided the girls a place to stay in the capital so that they could attend design school&#8212;another luxury. Meanwhile, in Sevnica, a place where most people still lived in drab apartments doled out to them by their factories, Viktor managed to build a house situated in what was considered the toniest part of town.</p>\n<p>“Trump reminds me of Viktor,” Viktor’s friend and neighbor Tomaž Jeraj tells me. “He’s a salesman. He has business in his veins.” It’s a sentiment unanimous in Sevnica, where Viktor and Amalija still own their house and visit two or three times a year.</p>\n<p>Indeed, if you look at photos of Viktor Knavs and Donald Trump side by side, you wouldn’t be surprised at the comparison. Donald is just five years younger than his father-in-law. Both are tall, portly men with blond hair and sharp suits; they’re brash men who like the finer things in life. “He likes quality,” says Melania. “Viki”&#8212;as Viktor is known to his friends here&#8212;“likes good food,” Jeraj tells me. “He loves cars.” He was one of the many people who would tell me about Viktor’s extensive collection of Mercedes. “You’ll never see him in another car.”</p>\n<p>Those who know the Knavses say that Viktor is boisterous and strong-willed. “Jokes come naturally to him,” Ana Jelančič, a neighbor and friend of the Knavses’, tells me. “If he goes into a bar, people pay attention.” Viktor sucks the air out of a room, she says. “He is the strong one in the relationship. Amalija supports him. She is a wonderful mother and wife.”</p>\n<p>Plenty of acquaintances hold the Knavses in high esteem. “They are the typical Slovenian family,” says Tomšič, the hospital director. “They are traditional, their family ties are very strong.” And friends of Viktor’s speak admiringly of his reputed business acumen. Another friend of Viktor’s tells me, “He’s a salesman. He follows the market.”</p>\n<p>Far from objecting to the comparison that’s made between her husband and her father, Melania agrees they’re a lot alike. “They’re both hardworking,” she says. “They’re both very smart and very capable. They grew up in totally different environments, but they have the same values, they have the same tradition. I myself am similar to my husband. Do you understand what I mean? So is my dad; he is a family man, he has tradition, he was hardworking. So is my husband.”</p>\n<p>Like Donald Trump, Viktor Knavs is not just a hard-charging businessman with a penchant for real estate; he is also viciously litigious when it comes to the women in his life. Back when Viktor was a driver, before he married Melania’s mother, he met a young woman in town named Marija Cigelnjak. They dated for a while, and in September 1964, she told Viktor she was pregnant. According to Cigelnjak’s testimony in a lengthy court record, Viktor offered to marry her, but quickly changed his mind, demanding that she have an abortion. This, Viktor said, was because the child was not his. A son was born in May 1965, and three months later, Marija sued Viktor for child support. Viktor continued to deny paternity&#8212;going into detail for the court about when he had sex with Marija and the rhythms of her menstrual cycle&#8212;prompting the court to order a blood test. Based on its results, the court determined that Viktor was, in fact, the boy’s biological father. Viktor fought the order to pay child support all the way to Slovenia’s highest appellate court. The courts always ruled in Cigelnjak’s favor. (The court record indicates that Viktor filed his appeal late&#8212;and lied brazenly and unconvincingly about the nature of the delay.)</p>\n<p>Viktor has never acknowledged his son, Denis Cigelnjak, who is now 50. The existence of Melania’s half brother has never been reported, and although he had never spoken to the media, he told me his story and then gave me permission to retrieve the relevant court documents from the Slovenian archives.</p>\n<p>He lives in a tiny apartment in Hrastnik, the town where his mother, who passed away several years ago, once worked at the glass factory. She never married or had more children, and Denis says he has no memory of ever meeting his father. Viktor paid child support until the boy was 18 but never reached out. “I missed being able to say, ‘Hey, Dad, let’s go for a coffee,’ ” Denis told me as we sat in his living room this spring. Periodically, Denis would hear stories about his father, but he said he was afraid to initiate contact and disturb the Knavs family. Now he feels it’s too late. He didn’t seek attention and says he wants nothing from his father or the Trumps. He wouldn’t mind meeting his half sisters, Ines and Melania, who, he’s fairly certain, don’t even know he exists. (When I asked Melania about this over the phone, she denied that it was true. Later, after I’d sent her documents from the Slovenian court, she wrote to me claiming she hadn’t understood what I’d asked, explaining, “I’ve known about this for years.” She added: “My father is a private individual. Please respect his privacy.”)</p>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"embed callout-embed-component dropcap \" data-type=\"callout\"><p>Everyone who remembers Melania from her youth in Slovenia recalls how striking she was. “She was a special kind of beauty, not the classic type,” a friend from Ljubljana told me. “She had eyes that were kind of psychedelic. You look in those eyes and it was like looking in the eyes of an animal.”</p>\n</div><p>Stane Jerko, the photographer credited with spotting Melania and producing her first real photo shoot back in 1987, saw something similar. He had glimpsed her waiting for her friend after a fashion show in Ljubljana. She was lanky and shy, with long hair and sparkling eyes. Jerko, who preferred to find his models in public places rather than through casting calls, had suggested she come by his studio. She wasn’t interested, he recalls. “School was the most important thing for her.” But a week later, she arrived, hair in a teenybopper ponytail, with a bushel of her own clothes: leggings, leotards, high-waisted acid-washed jeans, and a sleeveless sweater that looked like a wicker basket. She was reserved and tense but followed Jerko’s instructions and quickly figured out how to pose. He could see she had a future in front of the camera. A couple of weeks later, she returned, and Jerko snapped a series of black-and-white photos of a 16-year-old Melanija Knavs in some catalog clothes, barefoot in each image. It wasn’t a stylistic choice. “I didn’t have shoes for her because she had very big feet,” Jerko says of Melania, who wore the equivalent of a size 9 shoe. “The other models had smaller feet.” (You know what they say in Slovenia about people with big feet? Jerko asks, chuckling. “When you live on big feet, you live big.”)</p>\n<p>In those days, Melania wasn’t thinking about a career as a model. Like her sister, Ines, her goal was to become a designer, and she applied to the school of architecture at the local university, successfully passing the notoriously difficult entrance exams. In those years in Ljubljana, she was focused on school. She didn’t drink, didn’t party, didn’t smoke. Even after she met Jerko and began dabbling in modeling, she preferred to go home after work, to be with her equally quiet and reserved sister. “She kept to herself, she was a loner. After a shoot or a catwalk, she went home, not out. She didn’t want to waste time partying,” Jerko remembers.</p>\n<p>“Boys at that time liked more party girls, and we were not this,” Petra Sedej, Melania’s classmate in those days, tells me. Instead, they would gather in Melania’s or Petra’s apartment, “drink juice and talk.” Another old friend from Ljubljana recalls that Melania “was a bit special that way. She was really happy with those two, three, four people she was with. She didn’t need more.”</p>\n<div class=\"embed callout-embed-component inset-left \" data-type=\"callout\"><div class=\"embed pullquote \" data-type=\"pullquote\"><span class=\"pullquote-content\"><blockquote>\n<p>Melania scoffs when I ask if she had had a breast augmentation. “I didn’t make any changes,” she says.</p>\n</blockquote></span></div></div><p>Those who remember Melania also say she seemed somehow on a plane above her peers, her gaze always focused on a point above and beyond them. At an age when her classmates were pimply, casual high schoolers, Melania was always perfectly made up, recalls Sedej. Foundation, mascara, blush, lip gloss, all in just the right, subtle amount. “Even in summertime,” she says, “she was always perfect, every day.” In college, Melania dated a fellow model, a sought-after guy studying physical education. But she was unsatisfied with his lack of seriousness. He was a good-looking, sporty 20-year-old; she was a beautiful young woman who wanted something more than a hummingbird college romance. That this boy couldn’t provide what she sought disappointed Melania, Sedej says. “She was very sensitive. She wanted more.” Recalls another friend from those days, “We were all 20, but she was much more mature.”</p>\n<p>By 1992&#8212;the year Melania won second place in a Slovenian Look of the Year modeling contest&#8212;she seemed to have outgrown not just Ljubljana but all of newly independent Slovenia. The large media market of Yugoslavia&#8212;with some 24 million people&#8212;had been chopped up. Staying in her tiny new country of 2 million would mean the end of her modeling career. To have a shot at something bigger, at a real future in modeling, she had to move. “She was sure that there was nothing for her in Slovenia,” says the friend from Ljubljana. “She wanted to leave.”</p>\n<p>Melania decamped to Milan after her first year of college, effectively dropping out. Her connections to home grew faint. Sedej saw her for the occasional coffee on the rare occasions she visited Ljubljana, but has lost track of her since. She and her classmates wrote to Melania about their 20th high school reunion a few years ago. They e-mailed Melania’s representatives, they wrote to her on Facebook. There was no response. “She cut the line behind her,” says the friend from Ljubljana. “She started to live another life, and all this is behind her.”</p>\n<p>Melania thrived in Milan and Paris, and in 1996, having fallen in with Zampolli, the agent who brokered her visa and American modeling contract, she moved to New York with visions of truly making it big. But Melania, still only 26, would confront the perils of growing older as a model. “It was a frustrating age for models, the late 20s. It’s not a friendly industry to models of that age,” says Atanian, the former roommate. Zampolli’s agency paid Melania’s share of the rent as part of their contract. “She aired frustration over the work issue,” Atanian recalls. She wondered often why this or that photographer picked someone else over her, often someone younger. “She wasn’t working every day,” he added. “She was going to castings every day and not succeeding every day. She said things were very different in Europe, that she had been more successful.” Melania was having a hard time supporting herself, worried that her best years were behind her. (“Pictures tell for itself,” Melania says firmly when I ask her about Atanian’s characterization of this supposed tough patch. “My portfolio says what I did,” including “the best catalogs.”)</p>\n<p>In an increasingly unfriendly market, Melania looked for advantages. She went on casting calls for alcohol and tobacco ads, which her under-age competitors couldn’t be hired for. Once, she landed a Camel ad, a billboard in Times Square. She sought an edge in other ways. “She went away for a two-week vacation, then came back, and was more…buxom,” Atanian says, groping for the right but least offensive word. “She admitted it to me. She just said it needed to be done to get more lingerie jobs.”</p>\n<p>Again, Melania scoffs when I ask if she had had a breast augmentation. “I didn’t make any changes,” she says. “A lot of people say I am using all the procedures for my face. I didn’t do anything. I live a healthy life, I take care of my skin and my body. I’m against Botox, I’m against injections; I think it’s damaging your face, damaging your nerves. It’s all me. I will age gracefully, as my mom does.”</p>\n<p>In New York, Melania lived a quiet, homebound life, taking assiduous care of her body: walks with ankle weights, seven pieces of fruit every day, diligently moisturizing her skin. She rarely partied, never brought anyone back to the apartment, and was always home early. “She didn’t go out to dance clubs; she’d go to Cipriani for dinner at ten and be home by one,” Atanian recalls. “Men she would go out with tended to be wealthier, the industrious, European type. They were Italians, playboys. But they’d go out for dinner and she’d be home before I was.”</p>\n<p>It was Zampolli, again, who rescued her in 1998&#8212;with that invitation to the party at the Kit Kat Club, unwittingly putting her on a charmed trajectory toward a certain playboy’s phone number and, who knows, maybe even the White House.</p>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"embed callout-embed-component dropcap \" data-type=\"callout\"><p>Though she had appeared wordlessly behind her husband on plenty of stages throughout the long, weird winter of Trump’s primary march, Melania’s debut as a campaigner came on a snowy April night in Wisconsin. I was there for the unveiling and watched as her husband warmly ushered her to the podium. “She’s an incredible mother, she loves her son, Barron, so much,” he said. “And I have to say, she will make an unbelievable First Lady.” The crowd went wild. “I’d like to introduce my wife. Melania,” he said. “Come.”</p>\n</div><p>Obediently, she teetered out onto the stage on vertiginous Louboutins, a long-legged doll in a summery dress the color of sea foam. She was unseasonably tan, clearly comfortable in this role: being admired as a specimen of physical beauty. She began by reading from the remarks waiting for her at the podium, a list she’d compiled of her husband’s attributes. “He’s a hard worker. He’s kind. He has a great heart. He’s tough. He’s smart. He’s a great communicator. He’s a great negotiator. He’s telling the truth. He’s a great leader. He’s fair.”</p>\n<p>The speech&#8212;all short, declarative sentences&#8212;sounded like it had been written by her son as a homework assignment but quickly got to what sounded like recess talk. “As you may know by now, when you attack him, he will punch back ten times harder,” she said loudly, firmly, and to wild applause. “No matter who you are, a man or a woman. He treats everyone equal.”</p>\n<p>To Melania’s right, the presidential aspirant, the equal-opportunity puncher, nodded approvingly. Maybe Melania hadn’t wanted any of this a year ago&#8212;hadn’t wanted her husband to run, hadn’t wanted all the prying scrutiny, hadn’t wanted to become a politician’s wife. But here she was, taking the strangeness of life in her long, tan stride. She smiled, tautly, like a sphinx and beheld the throng before her. She was proud of her husband. He had a great heart.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><em><strong>Julia Ioffe</strong> is a contributing writer for <em>The New York Times Magazine</em>.

Maybe she’s made for Washington after all.","hed":"Melania Trump on Her Rise, Her Family Secrets, and Her True Political Views: “Nobody Will Ever Know”","inlineEmbeds":[{"id":"571e964a46f014b90abc2939","modelName":"photo","collection":"photos","aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":2000,"height":1333,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/gq/production/2016/04/25/571e964a46f014b90abc293b_malania-trump-02.jpg"}},"caption":"","credit":"Travis Dove/The New York Times/Redux","filename":"malania-trump-02.jpg","revision":4,"title":""},{"id":"571e964a46f014b90abc293c","modelName":"photo","collection":"photos","aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":2000,"height":1365,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/gq/production/2016/04/25/571e964a46f014b90abc293e_malania-trump-01.jpg"}},"caption":"","credit":"Matthew Peyton/Getty Images","filename":"malania-trump-01.jpg","revision":3,"title":""},{"id":"571fd7e16a2af99a11a1d824","modelName":"photo","collection":"photos","aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1295,"height":1850,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/gq/production/2016/04/26/571fd7e16a2af99a11a1d826_malania-trump-03.jpg"}},"caption":"Melania and Donald at Cipriani’s in 1999","credit":"Getty Images","filename":"malania-trump-03.jpg","revision":2,"title":""},{"id":"5720dd500b5c36b80bc2d127","modelName":"photo","collection":"photos","aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":865,"height":1299,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/gq/production/2016/04/27/5720dd500b5c36b80bc2d129_malania-trump-VIktor-Knavs.jpg"}},"caption":"Viktor and Amalija Knavs in Aberdeen, Scotland in 2011.","credit":"Donald Stewart, PacificCoastNews.com","filename":"malania-trump-VIktor-Knavs.jpg","revision":3,"title":""},{"id":"570bd4b79fcd51692b478dd2","modelName":"article","collection":"articles","body":"<div class=\"embed callout-embed-component dropcap \" data-type=\"callout\"><p>Something is dawning on us&#8212;it’s almost too soon for us to admit, but it’s there, a half-considered thought only now blooming in our brains. Maybe we dismiss it with one of those quick cognitive fly swats. <em>Nah, too early to say</em> or <em>I hate that guy.</em> But the truth is coming, and it sounds like this: Barack Obama will be inducted into the league of Great Presidents.</p>\n</div><p>Wait. One of the Greatest? you ask, your thumb emoticon poised to turn up or down on me. The guy haters love to hate with their very best hate game? Like 20-Dollar Bill great? Like Mount Rushmore great?</p>\n<p>Yep. (We just won’t build Mount Rushmores anymore.) In so many ways, Obama was better than we imagined, better than the body politic deserved, and far, far better than his enemies will ever concede, but the great thing about being great is that the verdict of enemies doesn’t matter.</p>\n<div class=\"embed callout-embed-component aside \" data-type=\"callout\"><h6><a href=\"https://subscribe.gq.com/subscribe/gq/96554?source=AMS_GQM_DESKTOP_FAILSAFE&amp;pos_name=AMS_GQM_DESKTOP_FAILSAFE\">Get one year of GQ for only $15! Click here to subscribe</a></h6>\n</div><p>In fact, and I say this as a Bill Clinton fan, I now feel certain that, in the coming decades, Obama’s star will rise higher than Clinton’s, and he’ll replace Bill in the public mind as the Greatest Democrat since FDR.</p>\n<p>This has to do with the nature of Obama’s leadership, which is to play to legacy (and Clinton’s impulse, which is to play to the room). Bill Clinton will long be revered because he’s charismatic, presided over an economic revival, and changed and elevated the view of the Democratic Party. Barack Obama will long be revered because he’s charismatic, presided over an economic revival, and changed and elevated the view of the <em>presidency.</em> He’s simply bigger than Bill.</p>\n<p>More to the point, Obama’s legacy is the sort that gets canonized. Because the first rule of Hall of Fame-dom: The times have to suck for the president not to. Civil wars, World Wars, depressions and recessions. You got to have ’em if you wanna be great. That’s why we rate the Washingtons, Lincolns, and Roosevelts over That Fat Guy with the Walrus Mustache. Like Obama, these Great Men were dealt sucky hands, won big, and left the country better off than it was before.</p>\n<div class=\"embed callout-embed-component inset-right \" data-type=\"callout\"><div class=\"embed pullquote \" data-type=\"pullquote\"><span class=\"pullquote-content\"><blockquote>\n<p>To unify where and however we can. In this way, too, Obama pointed the way forward.</p>\n</blockquote></span></div></div><p>But it’s also why we downgrade the Jimmy Carters and Herbert Hoovers. Were they as bad in real time as we remember them in history? Probably not. But they were dealt sucky hands, only played one round, and left the country feeling worse off. Legacy Game over. (Hoover reminds me more and more of Donald Trump! Elected with little political experience, Hoover was a rich bastard whose central theme was that government was wasteful. His answer to the Great Depression was to start a trade war and build a massive project called the Hoover Dam. The dam turned out to be a giant wall that did not stop or solve larger problems. Déjà vu, thy name is Trump Wall!)</p>\n<p>Obama has a few other edges in the long haul of history, beyond specific hurrah moments like Obamacare, rescuing the economy, and making America <em>way</em> more bi-curious. Being the first black president of course secures a certain legacy. But what now feels distinctly possible is that, just as Martin Luther King Jr. dreamed, over time he may be judged less for the color of his skin than for the content of his character. That character came across every time haters or Trumpers or birthers tried to pull him down into the mud or question his American-ness. He just flew above it all. And, luckily, he <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/pete-souza-obamas-chief-white-house-photographer-interview\">took most of us with him</a>. He was the Leader not only of our country but of our mood and disposition, which is harder to rule. At a time when we became more polarized, our discourse pettier and more poisoned, Obama always came across as the Adult in the Room, the one we wanted to be and follow.</p>\n<p>Ironically, one of the lock-ins to his Hall of Fame Greatness was originally supposed to be his Achilles’ heel, the shallow thing critics loved to smear him with: his eloquence, his “reliance” on speeches and teleprompters (Sarah Palin once famously screeched, “Mr. President…step away from the teleprompter and do your job!” while herself <em>reading from a teleprompter</em>), as if addressing the country as a whole, trying to unify or inspire people, were a superficial thing. But pivotal words at pivotal moments are not only how we come to admire great leaders, it’s the primary way we remember them. The first thing most people can recall about Lincoln? The Gettysburg Address. FDR? Fireside chats. George Washington? His amazing Snapchats. (George was first with <em>everything.</em>)</p>\n<p>With Obama, each thoughtful step of the way, from his soaring acceptance speech (“The road ahead will be long. Our climb will be steep…”) to his epic speeches on race and religion, his responses to the shootings in Tucson and Newtown, the killing of Osama bin Laden, the opening of Cuba <em>(“Todos somos Americanos!”),</em> and countless other momentous occasions, he knew how to speak to our better angels at a time when it was hard to locate <em>any</em> angels.</p>\n<p>Lastly, there’s the arc of history, bound to bend downward. As our unity becomes more frayed, more tenuous, and the ability for any politician to get anything done more unlikely, the job of president will become less LBJ tactical and less FDR big-dealer. The job will largely be to <em>preside.</em> To unify where and however we can. In this way, too, <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/barack-obama-preparing-for-third-term\">Obama pointed the way forward</a>.</p>\n<p>It may be hard to imagine now, but in the face of rising chaos, we’ll crave unity all the more, and in future years whoever can speak most <em>convincingly</em> of unity will rise to the top. (It’s also hard to imagine many beating Obama at the game.) This year’s carnival election, with Trump as a kind of debauched circus barker, only makes the distinction clearer. The absurdity and car-crash spectacle of it all have already lent Obama an out-of-time quality, as if <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/obama-the-nerd\">he were a creature from another, loftier century</a>. Whatever happens next, I feel this in my bones: We’ll look back at history, hopefully when we’re zooming down the Barack Obama Hyperloop Transport System, and think: That man was rare. And we were damn lucky to have him.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h5>WATCH NOW: Thanks Obama: Tom Ford, Chance the Rapper, Samantha Bee and Other Celebrities Send Off the Preside</h5>\n<figure class=\"embedded-video embedded-cnevideo\" data-src=\"//player.cnevids.com/script/video/587f277cfd2e61353b000000.js\" data-type=\"cnevideo\"></figure>","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"channels":[{"id":"59b038ed0a8d2f0976474f19","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Culture","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"culture"}],"famous-people":[{"id":"59b038eb7246eb56980ac792","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Barack Obama","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"barack-obama"}],"topics":[{"id":"59b038ecf667492236d9173f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Politics","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"politics"}]},"channel":"News & Culture","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5582cf211177d66d68d59831","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","name":"Jim Nelson","socialMedia":[]}]},"dek":"Already missing our former POTUS.","hed":"Why Obama Will Go Down as One of the Greatest Presidents of All Time","inlineEmbeds":[],"issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"","modifiedAt":"2017-08-09T15:58:04.030Z","photos":{"tout":[{"id":"570ea3c86069583e3cf8c5dc","modelName":"photo","collection":"photos","aspectRatios":{"3:2":{"width":1998,"height":1332,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":1,"y":0,"width":1998,"height":1332}}},"3:4":{"width":999,"height":1333,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":500,"y":0,"height":1333,"width":999}}},"64:25":{"width":1984,"height":775,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":0,"y":106,"height":775,"width":1984}}},"16:9":{"width":2000,"height":1125,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":0,"y":0,"width":2000,"height":1125}}},"4:3":{"width":1776,"height":1332,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":111,"y":0,"height":1332,"width":1776}}},"1:1":{"width":1333,"height":1333,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":333,"y":0,"width":1333,"height":1333}}},"master":{"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/gq/production/2016/04/13/570ea3c86069583e3cf8c5de_Obama-Editor-Letter-may-2016.jpg","width":2000,"height":1333}},"credit":"Illustration by GQ; Shakeil Greeley/Getty Images","filename":"Obama-Editor-Letter-may-2016.jpg","revision":2,"title":""}]},"promoDek":"GQ Editor-in-Chief Jim Nelson on the legacy of our soon-to-be-former POTUS","promoHed":"Obama Is One of the Greatest Presidents of All Time.

is dawning on us—it’s almost too soon for us to admit, but it’s there, a half-considered thought only now blooming in our brains. Maybe we dismiss it with one of those quick cognitive fly swats. *Nah, too early to say* or *I hate that guy.* But the truth is coming, and it sounds like this: Barack Obama will be inducted into the league of Great Presidents.\n\n+++\n\nWait. One of the Greatest? you ask, your thumb emoticon poised to turn up or down on me. The guy haters love to hate with their very best hate game? Like 20-Dollar Bill great? Like Mount Rushmore great?\n\nYep. (We just won’t build Mount Rushmores anymore.) In so many ways, Obama was better than we imagined, better than the body politic deserved, and far, far better than his enemies will ever concede, but the great thing about being great is that the verdict of enemies doesn’t matter.\n\n+++aside\n\n###### [Get one year of GQ for only $15! Click here to subscribe](https://subscribe.gq.com/subscribe/gq/96554?source=AMS_GQM_DESKTOP_FAILSAFE&pos_name=AMS_GQM_DESKTOP_FAILSAFE)\n\n+++\n\nIn fact, and I say this as a Bill Clinton fan, I now feel certain that, in the coming decades, Obama’s star will rise higher than Clinton’s, and he’ll replace Bill in the public mind as the Greatest Democrat since FDR.\n\nThis has to do with the nature of Obama’s leadership, which is to play to legacy (and Clinton’s impulse, which is to play to the room). Bill Clinton will long be revered because he’s charismatic, presided over an economic revival, and changed and elevated the view of the Democratic Party. Barack Obama will long be revered because he’s charismatic, presided over an economic revival, and changed and elevated the view of the *presidency.* He’s simply bigger than Bill.\n\nMore to the point, Obama’s legacy is the sort that gets canonized. Because the first rule of Hall of Fame-dom: The times have to suck for the president not to. Civil wars, World Wars, depressions and recessions. You got to have ’em if you wanna be great. That’s why we rate the Washingtons, Lincolns, and Roosevelts over That Fat Guy with the Walrus Mustache. Like Obama, these Great Men were dealt sucky hands, won big, and left the country better off than it was before.\n\n+++inset-right\n\n> To unify where and however we can. In this way, too, Obama pointed the way forward.\n\n+++\n\nBut it’s also why we downgrade the Jimmy Carters and Herbert Hoovers. Were they as bad in real time as we remember them in history? Probably not. But they were dealt sucky hands, only played one round, and left the country feeling worse off. Legacy Game over. (Hoover reminds me more and more of Donald Trump! Elected with little political experience, Hoover was a rich bastard whose central theme was that government was wasteful. His answer to the Great Depression was to start a trade war and build a massive project called the Hoover Dam. The dam turned out to be a giant wall that did not stop or solve larger problems. Déjà vu, thy name is Trump Wall!)\n\nObama has a few other edges in the long haul of history, beyond specific hurrah moments like Obamacare, rescuing the economy, and making America *way* more bi-curious. Being the first black president of course secures a certain legacy. But what now feels distinctly possible is that, just as Martin Luther King Jr. dreamed, over time he may be judged less for the color of his skin than for the content of his character. That character came across every time haters or Trumpers or birthers tried to pull him down into the mud or question his American-ness. He just flew above it all. And, luckily, he [took most of us with him](https://www.gq.com/story/pete-souza-obamas-chief-white-house-photographer-interview). He was the Leader not only of our country but of our mood and disposition, which is harder to rule. At a time when we became more polarized, our discourse pettier and more poisoned, Obama always came across as the Adult in the Room, the one we wanted to be and follow.\n\nIronically, one of the lock-ins to his Hall of Fame Greatness was originally supposed to be his Achilles’ heel, the shallow thing critics loved to smear him with: his eloquence, his “reliance” on speeches and teleprompters (Sarah Palin once famously screeched, “Mr. President…step away from the teleprompter and do your job!” while herself *reading from a teleprompter*), as if addressing the country as a whole, trying to unify or inspire people, were a superficial thing. But pivotal words at pivotal moments are not only how we come to admire great leaders, it’s the primary way we remember them. The first thing most people can recall about Lincoln? The Gettysburg Address. FDR? Fireside chats. George Washington? His amazing Snapchats. (George was first with *everything.*)\n\nWith Obama, each thoughtful step of the way, from his soaring acceptance speech (“The road ahead will be long. Our climb will be steep…”) to his epic speeches on race and religion, his responses to the shootings in Tucson and Newtown, the killing of Osama bin Laden, the opening of Cuba *(“Todos somos Americanos!”),* and countless other momentous occasions, he knew how to speak to our better angels at a time when it was hard to locate *any* angels.\n\nLastly, there’s the arc of history, bound to bend downward. As our unity becomes more frayed, more tenuous, and the ability for any politician to get anything done more unlikely, the job of president will become less LBJ tactical and less FDR big-dealer. The job will largely be to *preside.* To unify where and however we can. In this way, too, [Obama pointed the way forward](https://www.gq.com/story/barack-obama-preparing-for-third-term).\n\nIt may be hard to imagine now, but in the face of rising chaos, we’ll crave unity all the more, and in future years whoever can speak most *convincingly* of unity will rise to the top. (It’s also hard to imagine many beating Obama at the game.) This year’s carnival election, with Trump as a kind of debauched circus barker, only makes the distinction clearer. The absurdity and car-crash spectacle of it all have already lent Obama an out-of-time quality, as if [he were a creature from another, loftier century](https://www.gq.com/story/obama-the-nerd). Whatever happens next, I feel this in my bones: We’ll look back at history, hopefully when we’re zooming down the Barack Obama Hyperloop Transport System, and think: That man was rare. And we were damn lucky to have him.\n\n----------\n\n\n##### WATCH NOW: Thanks Obama: Tom Ford, Chance the Rapper, Samantha Bee and Other Celebrities Send Off the Preside\n\n[#cneembed: script/video/587f277cfd2e61353b000000.js]||||||","channel":"News & Culture","subChannel":"Politics","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"identifiable":true,"hierarchical":false},"revisionAuthor":"Stephen Aguila","issueDate":"","hed":"Why Obama Will Go Down as One of the Greatest Presidents of All Time","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[{"fields":{"name":"Culture","slug":"culture","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"59b038ed0a8d2f0976474f19","revision":0,"createdAt":"2017-09-06T18:05:33.571Z","modifiedAt":"2017-09-06T18:05:33.571Z","revisionCreatedAt":"2017-09-06T18:05:33.571Z","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"categories-colors":[],"contributorsPhotographer":[],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"revisionCreatedAt":"2016-02-23T18:41:10.829Z","meta":{"collectionName":"contributors","modelName":"contributor","publishable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"identifiable":true,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":false},"revisionAuthor":"Stephen Aguila","bio":"","name":"Jim Nelson","socialMedia":[],"id":"5582cf211177d66d68d59831","createdAt":"2015-06-18T14:01:05.489Z","revision":4,"modifiedAt":"2016-02-23T18:41:10.829Z","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors"}}],"publishHistory":{"searchable":true,"expired":false,"revisionAuthor":"CopilotUpdateTool","pubDate":"2016-04-14T16:01:00.000Z","uri":"story/obama-greatest-president-legacy","template":"full-bleed","createdAt":"2017-10-21T00:37:26.029Z","revision":45,"entityId":"570bd4b79fcd51692b478dd2"},"categories-franchises":[],"categories-shows-movies-documentaries":[],"categories-events":[],"categories-formats":[],"categories-holidays":[],"categories-famous-people":[{"fields":{"name":"Barack Obama","slug":"barack-obama","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"59b038eb7246eb56980ac792","revision":0,"createdAt":"2017-09-06T18:05:31.925Z","modifiedAt":"2017-09-06T18:05:31.925Z","revisionCreatedAt":"2017-09-06T18:05:31.925Z","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"videosLede":[],"categories-styles":[],"categories-topics":[{"fields":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"59b038ecf667492236d9173f","revision":0,"createdAt":"2017-09-06T18:05:32.458Z","modifiedAt":"2017-09-06T18:05:32.458Z","revisionCreatedAt":"2017-09-06T18:05:32.458Z","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"categories-products":[],"categories-destinations":[],"categories-materials":[],"photosTout":[{"fields":{"aspectRatios":{"3:2":{"width":1998,"height":1332,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":1,"y":0,"width":1998,"height":1332}}},"3:4":{"width":999,"height":1333,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":500,"y":0,"height":1333,"width":999}}},"64:25":{"width":1984,"height":775,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":0,"y":106,"height":775,"width":1984}}},"16:9":{"width":2000,"height":1125,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":0,"y":0,"width":2000,"height":1125}}},"4:3":{"width":1776,"height":1332,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":111,"y":0,"height":1332,"width":1776}}},"1:1":{"width":1333,"height":1333,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":333,"y":0,"width":1333,"height":1333}}},"master":{"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/gq/production/2016/04/13/570ea3c86069583e3cf8c5de_Obama-Editor-Letter-may-2016.jpg","width":2000,"height":1333}},"revisionCreatedAt":"2016-04-13T19:55:07.529Z","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","publishable":false,"image":true,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"identifiable":false,"hierarchical":false},"revisionAuthor":"Shakeil Greeley","filename":"Obama-Editor-Letter-may-2016.jpg","title":"Obama-Editor-Letter-may-2016.jpg","credit":"Illustration by GQ;

Throughout a year in which he has had some strange and deep effect on American politics, he has done a number of interviews here at his desk on the twenty-sixth floor of Trump Tower, Central Park stretching out in the distance behind him. Many of these encounters relay the same Trumpian idiosyncrasies&#8212;the way he always has impressive hot-off-the-press poll data to share, for instance, or the pleasure he takes in showing off the packed wall of Donald Trump magazine covers going back over 30 years (“cheaper than wallpaper,” he told <em>60 Minutes</em>), or the hyperbolic descriptions of his lifetime achievements.</p>\n</div><p>And no matter how many articles make note of these habits, or try to lampoon them, he&#39;s not giving them up.

Just came out.” Between us, lined up along the front of his desk, are stacks of all of the recent magazines with his face on the cover&#8212;<em>Rolling Stone, Time, People, Newsweek, New York,</em> multiple copies of each, as though as an additional sideline he has opened the world&#39;s most narrowly focused newsstand.</p>\n<p>As I settle in, his 27-year-old communications director, Hope Hicks, informs him that an article they have been expecting for a while about his time in military school has just been published.</p>\n<div class=\"embed callout-embed-component inset-right \" data-type=\"callout\"><div class=\"embed pullquote \" data-type=\"pullquote\"><span class=\"pullquote-content\"><blockquote>\n<p>“Are we gonna be the cover story, do you know?

(As it happens, I&#39;ve already read it online this morning; Ms. Hicks&#39;s summary is accurate.) “That&#39;s nice, huh?” he muses, and tells her he needs to write to his old classmates. “I heard they have some really nice quotes, and I haven&#39;t seen them in a long time.” He turns to me. “We get older, Chris, right? That&#39;s the bad part.”</p>\n<p>I entered the room using a cane, and he now asks, quite kindly and gently, a few questions about my problematic ankle. I tell him that it&#39;s pretty much fine now, though not what it once was.</p>\n<p>“Well, hey, what is?” he says. “Anyway, go ahead.”</p>\n<p>The conversation that follows&#8212;he makes clear at several points&#8212;isn&#39;t always to Trump&#39;s liking. At times I think his affront may be tactical, a way to better control the situation, but just as often he seems genuinely perplexed and annoyed that someone like him, a nice guy who is trying to give his best to the American people and who is riding high in every early poll, who is giving up his Monday lunchtime to share his considerable charm, should be asked to explain himself like this. In these moments, I have to remind myself of the remarkable and extensive catalog of incendiary comments he has made, and positions he has taken, as he has blitzkrieged the ill-prepared and undefended barricades of the American political process.</p>\n<p>But I start by discussing a small personal peculiarity.</p>\n<p><strong>GQ: You don&#39;t shake hands, do you? (1)</strong><br>\n<strong>DONALD TRUMP:</strong> Oh yeah, no, I do shake hands. Well, I&#39;ve been saying, and it&#39;s been borne out…if you have a cold, you pass the cold along to other people, or a flu. But no, I shake hands very gladly politically. I don&#39;t think you could be a politician if you didn&#39;t shake hands. Can you imagine if I refused to shake anybody&#39;s hands? <em>[“No,” chimes in Ms. Hicks, who will be remaining here for our interview.]</em> No&#8212;bottom line, I shake hands.</p>\n<div class=\"embed callout-embed-component aside \" data-type=\"callout\"><p><strong>1.</strong> In his 1997 book, <em>The Art of the Comeback,</em> in a chapter incidentally titled “The Press and Other Germs,” he spells out his philosophy on this issue most fully. “One of the curses of American society is the simple act of shaking hands,” he begins.</p>\n</div><p><strong>But if you go the whole way, you&#39;re going to have to touch a lot of dirty hands between now and next November.</strong><br>\nI&#39;ve been doing it. <em>[Ms. Hicks: “He&#39;s been doing it. Thirty thousand people at a rally the other week&#8212;he shook a lot of hands.”]</em> I&#39;ve been shaking thousands and thousands of hands on a daily basis, actually.</p>\n<p><strong>Does it make you shiver a little bit inside?</strong><br>\nNo, it&#39;s part of what I have to do to make America great again.</p>\n<p><strong>Are you having fun?</strong><br>\nI&#39;m having a good time. Because of the success of it, perhaps. It makes it a lot easier than some people that are not doing well. But I&#39;ve <em>really</em> enjoyed it. I really have.</p>\n<p><strong>Many years ago you said, “The fun is in the getting, not the having,” and I guess some people wonder whether that&#39;s your attitude toward the presidency.</strong><br>\nNo, actually in this case I don&#39;t think there&#39;s fun involved. It will be constant work to turn the country around because we have 50 million people on welfare, we have tremendous poverty levels at record numbers. We have almost a hundred million people out of work, out of the workforce. (2)</p>\n<div class=\"embed callout-embed-component aside \" data-type=\"callout\"><p><strong>2.</strong> Officially, there are actually 7.9 million unemployed people in America.</p>\n</div><p><strong>Putting it in the most basic way, there&#39;s a lot of people who really like you, but there&#39;s a lot of people who are deeply skeptical of your motives. Some people think it&#39;s a campaign driven by egotism, aimless ambition, and arrogance.</strong><br>\n<em>[slightly indignant half laugh]</em> This doesn&#39;t sound like a nice question! Look, I just have one thing in mind, and that&#39;s doing a great job for the country. Everybody has their detractors. Some people say arrogance, or whatever they may say. I only have one thing in mind and that&#39;s doing a great job for the country.</p>\n<p><strong>Whenever you explain why you&#39;d be a very fine president, a lot of what you say seems to boil down to: <em>Look, just shut up and trust me&#8212;I&#39;d be really good at this. I know I would.</em></strong><br>\nWell, I have been issuing a lot of policy over the last two-week period. But there is a certain amount of truth to that. I mean, I&#39;ve had tremendous success, and I&#39;ve just done it. And a lot of my supporters agree with that.</p>\n<p><strong>You&#39;ve broken many of the rules of how candidates usually act....</strong><br>\nThat&#39;s true. That, I agree with you. They say there&#39;s never been anything like this.</p>\n<p><strong>For instance, in recent times you&#39;ve referred to other people as: a loser, a total loser, a massive loser, grotesque, a moron, an obvious moron, a spoiled brat, a totally incompetent jerk, a stiff, a dummy, a bimbo, a clown, a low-class slob, a perv sleazebag, a major sleaze and buffoon, a spoiled brat without a properly functioning brain, a goofball atheist, a dope, a dummy dope, a dopey clown, a dog, and so on.</strong><br>\nWell, other people have said a lot of things about things, too. They&#39;ve said plenty of bad stuff.</p>\n<p><strong>But you&#39;ve got a vocabulary and an approach that&#39;s different.</strong><br>\nProbably. Probably that&#39;s why people are here, that&#39;s why I have this, you know. <em>[He gestures to the stacks of magazines lying between us.]</em> Every magazine cover. And maybe we&#39;ll have another. Are we gonna be the cover story, do you know? Or not? We should be, we should be. Based on merit, we should be. But we&#39;ll see. Not sure I want it. You&#39;re going to ask a positive question before the interview&#39;s over, right?</p>\n<p><strong>Well, I think the positive comes from the answer. Anyway, will you still talk like that if you&#39;re president?</strong><br>\nNo. Probably not.</p>\n<p><strong>Why not?</strong><br>\nDepends. It depends. I think probably I&#39;d be much different. I have a great capacity to be what I have to be, and as president you may want a different tone. But that&#39;s a highly competitive tone, and many of those expressions&#8212;not all, but many of those expressions&#8212;are highly descriptive. It&#39;s hard to find words to compete with them when talking about somebody. But no, I would imagine I would be quite a bit different. I would feel differently about things as a president. Right now, I&#39;m fighting a lot of people. As a president I would be more measured.</p>\n<p><strong>But part of your appeal, and part of what you&#39;re selling as your appeal, is that you&#39;re different. And if people are going to vote for you, surely they want the real Donald Trump to be the president?</strong><br>\nYeah, I would be. I wouldn&#39;t change much, but I think I would probably tone down the rhetoric, perhaps. And perhaps not. Depends on who it was that I was speaking about. We have some bad dudes out there.</p>\n<p><strong>If anyone attacks you, you bite back pretty hard, don&#39;t you?</strong><br>\nYes. Yes.</p>\n<p><strong>If you were the same kind of president as you are a candidate, it sometimes feels like the first time some country disrespected you, you&#39;d just want to nuke them.</strong><br>\nNo, no, no. But some of these countries are really taking advantage of us and I would fight for fairness of our country.</p>\n<p><strong>But would you be scared to nuke them if you thought it was justified?</strong><br>\nI wouldn&#39;t be nuking anybody.</p>\n<p><strong>Under any circumstances?</strong><br>\nUnder… I will have a military that&#39;s so strong and powerful, and so respected, we&#39;re not gonna have to nuke anybody.</p>\n<p><strong>So could we get rid of the weapons?</strong><br>\nNo, no, we wouldn&#39;t get rid of the weapons. Because you have so many people out there. But I would be somebody that would be amazingly calm under pressure.</p>\n<p><strong>But if you&#39;re not going to use them, what&#39;s the point in having them?</strong><br>\nThe fact that other people have them. And unfortunately gaining more and more.</p>\n<p><strong>But ultimately you have to be prepared to press the button or there&#39;s no point in having them?</strong><br>\nWell, I don&#39;t want to talk about that subject because that&#39;s not a subject that, you know… <em>[restarts his thought]</em> that has to do with that whole… <em>[restarts his thought again]</em> I just don&#39;t want to talk about it. It is highly, highly, highly, highly unlikely that I would ever be using them.</p>\n<p><strong>As you know, people ask a lot of questions about your attitude toward women. When you were asked on <em>The View</em> what your message was to women and you said you wanted to cherish them, protect them,</strong> take care of them&#8212;<br>\nAnd respect them, yes. I do respect them, I have great respect for women. In fact, one of the reasons <em>The Apprentice</em> was such a successful show for so many years, the audience of women was fantastic.</p>\n<p><strong>Sure, but that&#39;s an entertainment TV show.</strong><br>\nNo, but it&#39;s indicative. I have great respect for women, and I will do more for women than anybody because I get things done and I know how to do things. And I&#39;ll also keep this country safe and secure, which a politician probably won&#39;t, because they&#39;re weak and ineffective. They&#39;re weak, ineffective people, politicians.</p>\n<p><strong>What do you say to the women who respond: I&#39;m not that bothered about being “cherished” or “protected” or “taken care of,” I just want to be treated equally?</strong><br>\nI think you&#39;re being politically correct when you ask me a question like that. They do want to be taken care of and they do want to be cherished and they do want to be respected, and I think when you ask a question like that you&#39;re just trying to be politically correct, that&#39;s all. But that&#39;s okay.</p>\n<p><strong>You&#39;d never say you were going to “cherish” men, would you?</strong><br>\nI would. I would. I would cherish men. I cherish all people in their lives. I think it&#39;s very important. No, I would cherish men, I would cherish women&#8212;I want to take care of everybody.</p>\n<p><strong>Obviously another issue that some people have taken&#8212;</strong><br>\n<em>[interrupts]</em> Did anybody ever say anything positive about me? This is not looking... This is not looking good. So far I haven&#39;t been asked one positive question. But that&#39;s okay. Whatever. Whatever. <em>[exhales loudly through pursed lips]</em></p>\n<p><strong>People expect you to be asked tough questions, and you&#39;re certainly up to answering them.</strong><br>\nSure I am, but, I mean, you know, so far, in all fairness, you&#39;ve only asked me, like, really negative questions. Wow. I&#39;m saying, this article&#39;s going to be a disaster. <em>[Ms. Hicks: “I think we deserve the cover just for tolerating these questions.”]</em> It&#39;s all right. Whatever.</p>\n<p><strong>A similar issue that people are giving you a hard time about is race.</strong><br>\nI don&#39;t think so. Race? Nobody&#39;s giving me a hard time. I just won… I just had the highest percentage ever in a Republican primary&#8212;25 percent of the African-Americans supported me. (3) So I don&#39;t think you&#39;re right.</p>\n<p><strong>But certainly a lot of people have written, and some people suspect, that even if you&#39;re not racist yourself, you&#39;re consciously pandering to racist sentiments in parts of the electorate.</strong><br>\n<em>[Ms. Hicks to Trump: “Shall we wrap this up?”]</em> I&#39;ve never heard that. Yeah, well, I&#39;ve never heard that. No, I mean I am the least racist person that you have ever met.</p>\n<div class=\"embed callout-embed-component aside \" data-type=\"callout\"><p><strong>3</strong>. He is presumably referring to an opinion poll of voting intentions. Not a single vote has yet been cast, for Donald Trump or any other candidate, in this year&#39;s Republican primaries.</p>\n</div><p><strong>Obviously there&#39;s a big movement, the Black Lives Matter movement…</strong><br>\nI don&#39;t know&#8212;is it a big movement? I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s big or if it&#39;s small.</p>\n<p><strong>What do you make of it?</strong><br>\nI don&#39;t make anything of it. I saw them steal the microphone from Bernie Sanders and he just yielded, which surprised me. But no, I don&#39;t know anything about… You know, when you say it&#39;s a big movement, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a big movement. You think it&#39;s a big movement?</p>\n<p><strong>It&#39;s very hard to quantify. It&#39;s certainly a loud movement. And I think it&#39;s an interesting and important idea.</strong><br>\nYou think it is, actually? Black lives matter? But do you think white lives matter?</p>\n<p><strong>Well, the more common response is for people to say “all lives matter,” though I understand why some people consider that kind of tone-deaf.</strong><br>\nTo me, all lives matter. All lives matter.</p>\n<p><strong>But can you see how people who are fighting to point out a particular injustice&#8212;</strong><br>\n<em>[interrupts]</em> No. No, I can&#39;t. I can&#39;t understand that term, no. I think that term is hurting them, not helping them.</p>\n<p><strong>As you know, there&#39;s a lot of chatter that if the going gets tough and you go down in the polls, people think you&#39;ll just quit.</strong><br>\nThere is? I haven&#39;t…</p>\n<div class=\"embed callout-embed-component inset-right \" data-type=\"callout\"><p><strong>4</strong>. It was Trump who had fueled the subject four days earlier: When CNBC had asked him whether he would exit the race if he were no longer leading the polls, he replied, “Well, I&#39;m not a masochist.… If I fell behind badly, I would certainly get out.” Inevitably other TV interviewers followed up, and he repeated variations of the “I&#39;m not a masochist” line, perhaps until he realized that it was giving an unproductive impression. Hence yesterday&#39;s tweet: <em>I&#39;m leading by big margins in every poll but the press keeps asking, would you ever get out? They are just troublemakers, I&#39;m going to win!</em></p>\n</div><p><strong>You tweeted about it yesterday.

I&#39;m not in to play games, I&#39;m not in to come in second and have everybody say how brilliant I was, and how it was the Summer of Trump&#8212;and even now the Autumn of Trump, because I&#39;m doing very well still.

It is my hair, by the way, as you know. As you can probably tell. Yeah, I thought the wig was terrible. I thought everything was fine, (5) but I thought the wig was terrible.

To me, it&#39;s not that unusual. It&#39;s not unusual because it&#39;s the way I&#39;ve been combing it for a long time, since I&#39;m in school.</p>\n<p><strong>It is unusual the way it goes forward and backward.</strong><br>\nNo, it&#39;s not really forward and it&#39;s not really… You know, if you look you know it&#39;s not actually a comb-over.</p>\n<p><strong>I guess people are interested in it now because they think it&#39;s a sign of a sort of vanity.</strong><br>\nVanity? Sure. Maybe it is, maybe it isn&#39;t.

He couldn’t always harness it. He couldn’t stop trying to win everyone over, whether it was a <em>60 Minutes</em> correspondent, 500 powerful donors in a crowded banquet hall, or a fetching woman on a rope line.</p>\n<p>If Clinton acted like someone who ran Capitol Records, Obama&#8212;both the person <em>and</em> the president&#8212;carries himself like Roger Federer, a merciless competitor who keeps coming and coming, only there’s a serenity about him that\ndisarms just about everyone. At one point during the hour I spent interviewing him at the White House this fall, he casually compared himself to Aaron Rodgers, and he wasn’t bragging. Obama identified with Rodgers’s ability to keep his focus downfield despite all the chaos happening in front of him. That’s Obama’s enduring quality,\nand (to borrow another sports term) this has been his “career year.”</p>\n<p>Obama lives in America’s most famous museum and uses it to his advantage. You’re sitting there in some ancient tearoom waiting for him to show up, surrounded by portraits of former first ladies and framed maps from battles\nthat America won over the centuries. Everyone is friendly but suspicious. Everyone talks in hushed tones. You feel like you’re intruding at all times. You’re just…waiting. Suddenly, ten anonymous security guards pop out of hallways\nand doorways that you didn’t know were there. The energy shifts. And then, there’s Obama&#8212;big smile, big handshake, some ball-busting comments to put everyone at ease. Within seconds of greeting me, he was poking fun at my shoes and teasing me for not writing anymore.</p>\n<p>“It’s really aggravating not having you on Grantland,” he said, almost like I betrayed him. “I go to the site and there’s no Simmons. Come on, man, it’s not the same.”</p>\n<div class=\"embed callout-embed-component aside \" data-type=\"callout\"><div class=\"embed pullquote \" data-type=\"pullquote\"><span class=\"pullquote-content\"><blockquote>\n<p>“It’s really aggravating not having you on Grantland,” he said, almost like I betrayed him. “I go to the site and there’s no Simmons. Come on, man, it’s not the same.”</p>\n</blockquote></span></div></div><p>It’s an alpha-male trick&#8212;put someone off-balance, flatter them and bust their chops at the same time. A few minutes later, he was grabbing control of the interview with measured responses, knowing that he didn’t have to perform\nwithout cameras or podcast equipment. And so he took his time. And it worked. I mean, how do you interrupt the most powerful man on earth? It felt like the way Federer repeatedly jumped Novak Djokovic’s second serve in the 2015 U.S. Open Final&#8212;a savvy trick to disrupt someone’s flow, a seemingly harmless way to gain an edge. It’s what the great competitors do.</p>\n<p>In January, Obama will begin his eighth and final year on the job. It’s an <em>era</em> now. What has he learned about leadership? What was his biggest regret? Why did it seem like, in 2015, he finally started letting it fly, threw on his Beefsquatch costume and let everyone know “THIS IS ME NOW!” Gay marriage, health care, Charleston, the Iran deal… If you voted against him, 2015 was the year when his inner confidence bothered you more than ever. And if you voted for him, 2015 was definitely the year when you said, “<em>That</em> is the guy I voted for.” But what if Barack Obama has been that guy all along?</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>BILL SIMMONS: If you could go back to 2008 and tell yourself one thing, what would it be?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>BARACK OBAMA:</strong> “You’re going to be busy.” Coming in, we were going through an unprecedented economic upheaval, combined with an upheaval in the Middle East that we hadn’t seen in our lifetimes. There was going\nto be a huge amount of disruption. I would probably tell myself to communicate more effectively early on than I did. We ran a great campaign. It wasn’t as great as it seems in retrospect&#8212;there’s always rose-colored glasses but there’s no doubt that we captured the country’s imagination. And somehow in those first two years, I think a certain arrogance crept in, in the sense of thinking as long as we get the policy ready, we didn’t have to sell it.</p>\n<p>One thing I learned through some tough election cycles: You can’t separate good policy from the need to bring the American people along and make sure that they know why you’re doing what you’re doing. And that’s particularly\ntrue now in this new communications era. I think that we were ahead of the curve in 2008 in social media and the Internet and digital communications. When we came into office, instead of taking some of those lessons, we\nsuddenly adapted ourselves to the White House press room and structures that had been built back in the 1940s and ’50s. As a consequence of those missteps early, we got the policies right, and that’s why the economy now has grown for five and a half straight years, six years, and why unemployment rates have gone from 10 percent to 5.1 percent. But there was a lot of political pain along the way that might not have been necessary.</p>\n<p><strong>Was there a point in those first three years where you started to feel overwhelmed by the job? Where you\nwere just like, “My God, I just had no idea this was going to be this hard!”</strong><br>\nI had a pretty good handle. One thing I learned during the campaign was that I’ve got a good temperament. I don’t get too high and I don’t get too low. I’m able to stay focused even when there’s a lot of stuff going on around me.</p>\n<p><strong>So you’re like Gregg Popovich. Although he does get mad at sideline reporters.</strong><br>\n<em>[laughs]</em> He does. So do I. <em>[laughs]</em> Yeah. Or maybe [Aaron] Rodgers in the pocket, in the sense of you can’t be distracted by what’s around you, you’ve got to be looking downfield. And I think that’s a quality that I have&#8212;not getting flustered in what’s around me. So there was never a point, even early on&#8212;even in the first six months, where we weren’t sure whether we were going to dip into another Great Depression, we weren’t sure whether the steps we were taking on rescuing the auto industry or stabilizing the financial system were going to work&#8212;there weren’t moments where I thought, “Sheesh, feels like we’re in over our head.”</p>\n<p>But what I didn’t fully appreciate, and nobody can appreciate until they’re in the position, is how decentralized power is in this system. When you’re in the seat and you’re seeing the housing market collapse and you are seeing unemployment skyrocketing and you have a sense of what the right thing to do is, then you realize, “Okay, not only do I have to persuade my own party, not only do I have to prevent the other party from blocking what the right thing to do is, but now I can anticipate this lawsuit, this lobbying taking place, and this federal agency that technically is independent, so I can’t tell them what to do. I’ve got the Federal Reserve, and I’m hoping that they do the right thing&#8212;and by the way, since the economy now is global, I’ve got to make sure that the Europeans, the Asians, the Chinese, everybody is on board.” A lot of the work is not just identifying the right policy but now constantly building these ever shifting coalitions to be able to actually implement and execute and get it done.</p>\n<p><strong>You’re out to dinner with your wife and the phone rings. How many of the people in your life are you like, “Uh-oh, I’ve got to take this”?</strong><br>\nMalia and Sasha. <em>[laughs]</em> And maybe my mother-in-law. My national security adviser, Susan Rice, and Denis McDonough, my chief of staff. Those are the only people whose call I would take during a date night with Michelle. But the entire White House is full of people who have enormous responsibilities. You can’t do this by yourself. The principle of team building in the White House is really no different than the principle of team building anywhere, on a sports team or a well-run business. Do they put team ahead of themselves? Do you make sure all the pieces fit together? Because just having the best athletes, if they’re knocking heads and nobody’s doing rebounding and everybody wants the ball, it isn’t always going to work.</p>\n<p><strong>Is it fair to say that in 2015, you’ve been like the second-semester high school senior who got into Yale and now is like, “I’m going out tonight&#8212;I don’t care if I have a test tomorrow”? All of us were kind of waiting for that guy to show up after he got re-elected. What took two years to get there?</strong><br>\nThere’s no doubt that the longer I’m in this job, the more confident I am about the decisions I’m making and more knowledgeable about the responses I can expect. And as a consequence, you end up being looser. There’s not much I have not seen at this point, and I know what to expect, and I can anticipate more than I did before.</p>\n<p>I [also] have a case to make now that was harder to make earlier in my presidency. We had confidence, for example, that the economic decisions that we made to stabilize the financial system and pass Wall Street reform and raise\ntaxes on the wealthiest and pass health care&#8212;that would have a payoff. But because we had been in such a deep hole, we had to be careful about crowing success when people weren’t feeling it. And it wasn’t really until around 2014 where the attitude of the American people was, “The economy’s improving, I’m feeling better.”</p>\n<p><strong>So you feed off that.</strong><br>\nYou can make your case without caveats, which, I think, hampered my ability to communicate confidence and optimism to people. You didn’t want people to feel as if you were getting ahead of yourself. It’s a combination of me feeling looser because I’ve just been in this job a long time and have gone through some tough stretches. Not only do you not look like you have any fear, but you actually <em>don’t</em> have any fear. And I don’t at this point. The bets we made early on have paid off. Some of it does have to do with luck.</p>\n<p>Think about 2013, right after I’d been re-elected: Our goal was to lead with a big push on immigration reform. And then, before the second inauguration has even happened, [the school shooting at] Sandy Hook happens. Which remains, by the way, the worst few days of my presidency. I went up and visited with those families and&#8212;you know, Bill, you’ve still got small kids. These are 6-year-olds, right? And you have 20 of them who’ve been massacred. Right away, our focus had to shift to “Is there a way for us to capture this moment to see if we can get over this incredible hump to try to put in place some common-sense gun-safety rules?” And we knew it was a stretch, just because of the politics of Congress and the NRA. But we had to try.</p>\n<p>And throughout 2013 and 2014, you had a series of events like that&#8212;the Snowden disclosures, Ebola, Ferguson, ISIL, and unaccompanied children coming across the borders&#8212;all sort of stacked up in a row. None of them individually unsolvable, but given the 24/7 news cycle, they just sort of pile up on each other. Even though, in the midst of this, the economy is improving and we are making real progress on education and health care and energy and so forth, political momentum turns sharply against you. And so we’ve had more than our share of stormy seas, but we’ve navigated the ship well.</p>\n<p><strong>When Ferguson happened last year, I was waiting for Obama the Person to come in. But you had to be President Obama. How you handled Charleston this year and Selma&#8212;that was Obama the Person. So what happened with Ferguson? Do you wish you had handled that differently?</strong><br>\nYou know, the challenge of Ferguson and all issues related to police shootings, race, and the criminal-justice system is that in order to actually get something done, you have to build consensus. Expressing simple outrage without\nfollow-up is often counterproductive. In the case of Ferguson, I’m the attorney general’s boss. If I chime in with a strong opinion about what’s happened, not only do I stand to potentially damage subsequent law-enforcement cases, but immediately you get blowback and backlash that may make people less open to listening. What was different in Charleston was the clarity of what happened&#8212;that allowed, I think, everybody to be open to it.</p>\n<div class=\"embed callout-embed-component inset-right \" data-type=\"callout\"><div class=\"embed pullquote \" data-type=\"pullquote\"><span class=\"pullquote-content\"><blockquote>\n<p>“The fact that race has always been the fault line of our society and has always distorted our politics&#8212;that is not subject to argument. Part of what you’re looking for is a way not to just vent but to actually move the people.”</p>\n</blockquote></span></div></div><p><strong>Did it take time during the presidency to realize what kind of moments those were?</strong><br>\nYes, sometimes it’s feel. Sometimes the circumstances won’t give you a clean statement. The fact that race has always been the fault line of our society and has always distorted our politics&#8212;that is not subject to argument. Part of what you’re looking for is a way not to just vent but to actually move the people. I practiced law for a while&#8212;a lot of times, hard cases can make bad law. If you have an issue that you want to put forward, you’re looking for the right plaintiff and the right court to appear before. I do think as you go on as president, you get a better feel for this, but you’re not always going to be perfect. When the Trayvon Martin case happened, I had an honest response as a father that I think resonated with a lot of people. When Ferguson happened, there was a gap between how quickly we could pull together a police task force, recommendations. And so in that lag, it feels as if I haven’t spoken to the moment as effectively. I suspect that if I were to do it over again, there might be something I could say that would’ve crystallized it more effectively. But Ferguson&#8212;the case itself was tougher because people didn’t know what was going on exactly. In some ways the [Eric] Garner case in New York was clearer because you had on videotape exactly what had happened, and some of the subsequent cases have been more obvious.</p>\n<p>One thing you learn as president is you’re not always going to perform flawlessly and you have to be able to put that out of your mind and then look at the next problem coming down the pipe. If I’m working out in the gym, sometimes I’ll go to NBA Classics and watch some of these old classic games&#8212;</p>\n<p><strong>The lack of HD really hurts&#8212;you can barely see anybody.</strong><br>\nIt’s true&#8212;and the graphics at the bottom are terrible. But a thing that you’re reminded of, watching those old Bulls games, is Jordan had some stinker games in the playoffs. But he would get that out of his mind, and then the next moment comes and he’s right there. He could have a terrible game for the first three quarters and then suddenly go crazy the fourth. Or he might miss a free throw, and then the next play is he’s stealing the ball and hitting the game-winning shot. Part of what I try to do&#8212;not at the level that Jordan did on the basketball court, but part of what you aspire to as president or any of these positions of leadership&#8212;is to try to figure out how to be in the moment, make the best decision you can, know that you’re going to get a bunch of them right, but a bunch of times you’re also not going to get it exactly the way you want it.</p>\n<p><strong>You win the election in 2008, and Twitter is just becoming a thing. Over the course of your presidency, that’s the biggest thing that’s changed. What’s the biggest challenge with all that stuff?</strong><br>\nSpeed. You are on 24/7&#8212;you have to respond immediately. The job of our office, to keep up and to respond quickly to anything that’s happening but not be consumed by it, is completely different. We’ve been building a digital team inside the White House.</p>\n<p><strong>When did that start?</strong><br>\nToo late. That’s an example of something that I would’ve started earlier. That was a lesson that coming out of the first term, I should’ve understood. That’s why we built this team. It’s so interesting watching my daughters. Both are complete ninjas on the phone, right? And they can do things that I don’t even understand&#8212;they’re doing it in two seconds. But I even see a difference between Malia, who’s 17, and Sasha, who’s 14. There’s almost a mini-generational gap in terms of Sasha being so connected seamlessly to this smartphone in a way that Malia, who was already a little bit older when it really started to take, is not.</p>\n<p><strong>The ability to multitask with 19 different friends at the same time…</strong><br>\nYeah. And just the degree to which her social life is so connected to that. So it’s not just having to change how we do business inside the White House to react to stories, but also, how do we tell a story about issues to constituencies that are completely splintered, who don’t watch television in the same way, who don’t watch the news in the same way? In some ways we’re just laying the foundation for what I assume will be the standard practice of future presidents.</p>\n<p><strong>Gun control: You’ve tried to legislate it as much as you possibly could and hit a wall basically in every direction. But the one thing Hillary Clinton has brought up is executive action.</strong><br>\nWell, keep in mind that after Sandy Hook, we put forward 23 executive actions. So we haven’t been asleep at the switch in terms of executive actions that we’ve tried. There are maybe a few more that had to be scrubbed by lawyers because, essentially, with every executive action, we can count on it being challenged by somebody in Congress or, in this case, the NRA. We want to make any executive action we take as defensible as possible legally. In the absence of a movement politically in which people say, “Enough is enough,” we’re going to continue to see, unfortunately, these tragedies take place. The main thing that I’ve been trying to communicate over the last several of these horrific episodes is that, contrary to popular belief, Americans are not more violent than people in other developed countries. But they have more deadly weapons to act out their rage, and that’s the only main variable that you see between the U.S. and these other countries.</p>\n<p><strong>It does feel like it’s going to become the dominant issue of year eight.</strong><br>\nI hope so. We have this weird habit in this culture of mourning and, you know, 48, 72 hours of wall-to-wall coverage, and then…suddenly we move on. And I will do everything I can to make sure that there’s a sustained attention paid to this thing.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s the most entertaining conspiracy theory you ever read about yourself?</strong><br>\nThat military exercises we were doing in Texas were designed to begin martial law so that I could usurp the Constitution and stay in power longer. Anybody who thinks I could get away with telling Michelle I’m going to be president any longer than eight years does not know my wife.</p>\n<p><strong>Have you ever said, “Give me the JFK-assassination files, I want to read them. Give me all the secret stuff”?</strong><br>\nI gotta tell you, it’s a little disappointing. People always ask me about Roswell and the aliens and UFOs, and it turns out the stuff going on that’s top secret isn’t nearly as exciting as you expect. In this day and age, it’s not as top secret as you’d think.</p>\n<p><strong>Would you ever want to be a Supreme Court justice?</strong><br>\n<em>[pauses]</em></p>\n<p><strong>You paused!</strong><br>\nNo&#8212;well, the reason I paused for a second was just to make sure that I let people know that I think good judges are really important, and Supreme Court justices, obviously, are hugely important. I don’t have the temperament to sit in relative solitude and just opine and write from the bench. I want to be in the action a little bit more.</p>\n<p><strong>Is it true you have a virtual driving range in the White House?</strong><br>\nTrue.</p>\n<p><strong>It’s in the bowels of the White House?</strong><br>\nYeah, I mean, this is not like some super-fancy thing. But I can hit these Wiffle balls.</p>\n<p><strong>So you go down there and hit, like as a stress reliever?</strong><br>\nYeah. Just whack ’em. Whack ’em around a little bit.</p>\n<p><strong>Has anyone come to the White House and picked up your older daughter for a date?</strong><br>\nNo, but I’ve seen some folks glancing at her in ways that made me not happy.</p>\n<p><strong>Tell the Secret Service, “Just take out that guy over there”?</strong><br>\n“Just keep an eye on him.”</p>\n<p><strong>Does it scare you that your wife could have a billion-dollar daytime talk show and you could be Stedman 2.0?</strong><br>\n<em>[laughs]</em> Uh…</p>\n<p><strong>Because that’s in play. She could do that if she wanted.</strong><br>\nAnd if that’s what she wants to do, I’m okay with her making a whole lot of money. There’s nothing wrong with that.</p>\n<p><strong>Would you ever want to be part of the ownership for an NBA team?</strong><br>\nAbsolutely.</p>\n<p><strong>Would it have to be the Bulls, or would it have to be somebody else?</strong><br>\nWell, you know, I know [Jerry] Reinsdorf pretty good&#8212;he’s not giving that thing up anytime soon. But I have fantasized about being able to put together a team and how much fun that would be. I think it’d be terrific.</p>\n<p><strong>How many times have you said to your kids, “Stop Googling me”?</strong><br>\nI don’t have to tell them that. They have no interest in me. I mean, they’re hopefully interested in me as a father.</p>\n<p><strong>Not as a public figure. What’s your guiltiest-pleasure TV show? Don’t say <em>Game of Thrones</em>, because that’s a good show.</strong><br>\nProbably the guiltiest pleasure&#8212;and this is kind of lame&#8212;is <em>Big Break</em>. You know, on the Golf Channel? Which is kind of a silly show. <em>[laughs]</em> But I find it really relaxing.</p>\n<div class=\"embed callout-embed-component aside \" data-type=\"callout\"><div class=\"embed pullquote \" data-type=\"pullquote\"><span class=\"pullquote-content\"><blockquote>\n<p>“Probably the guiltiest pleasure&#8212;and this is kind of lame&#8212;is <em>Big Break</em>.

I never see all the episodes, but if they’ve got some chipping contest or something… <em>[laughs]</em> It’s pretty lame. I do love <em>Game of Thrones</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Which character do you identify with?</strong><br>\nMy favorite character is probably…the dwarf, what’s his name?</p>\n<p><strong>Oh, yeah. Peter Dinklage’s character.</strong><br>\nThe problem with <em>Game of Thrones,</em> though, is that I don’t remember the names of any of the characters.</p>\n<p><strong>I don’t, either.</strong><br>\nI remember the characters, so when I watch it, I know exactly what’s going on. But if you read a review of the show afterwards and they’re mentioning such and such, the only one I remember is Jon Snow, because I can pronounce Jon Snow.</p>\n<p><strong>Which <em>Game of Thrones</em> character is Donald Trump?</strong><br>\nUh…I don’t think…I don’t think any of them rise to that level.</p>\n<p><strong>If you were campaigning against Trump, would you even bother? Would it be like LaBradford Smith talking trash to Jordan or something?</strong><br>\nI would’ve enjoyed campaigning against Trump. That would’ve been fun.</p>\n<p><strong>Which leadership style suits your vision of where America should go forward? Biden or Hillary?</strong><br>\n<em>[laughs]</em> Come on, Bill.</p>\n<p><strong>I had to ask you one thing you can’t answer! Here’s one you have to answer: Who’s more untradable, Derrick Rose or Jay Cutler?</strong><br>\n<em>[pause]</em> Oh, I think Rose still has more upside. Remember, Rose is still awfully young.</p>\n<p><strong>So you haven’t given up on Rose?</strong><br>\nI’ve not given up on him. Sadly, I think it’s hard to imagine, after that many injuries, him getting back to his MVP-season performance. But he can still be a top-ten point guard.</p>\n<p><strong>Baseball, football, basketball, all the commissioner jobs open up next year. Which one would you want?</strong><br>\nWell, I’m best suited for basketball. But I cannot believe that the commissioner of football gets paid\n$44 million a year.</p>\n<p><strong>When you said, “I cannot believe…,” I didn’t know where you were going with that. Have you thought about calling <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/roger-goodell-season-from-hell\">Roger Goodell</a> and being like, “What are you <em>doing?</em> Can I help you?” [<em>Obama laughs</em>.] “Can I give you some advice? Want to have dinner?”</strong><br>\nThey’re making a profit, and I think that’s what the owners are most concerned with.</p>\n<p><strong>So you think the owners like having him there?</strong><br>\nYou’re not going to drag me into your fights, man. Come on&#8212;I’ve got enough fights of my own. <em>[laughs]</em> This is between you and Roger.</p>\n<p><strong>Number of cigarettes you’ve smoked in the White House since you got here?</strong><br>\nZero in the last five years. I made a promise that once health care passed, I would never have a cigarette again. And I have not.</p>\n<p><strong>What perk of being president are you going to miss the most?</strong><br>\nSo the clear answer would be Air Force One: an amazing plane with an amazing crew, they clear out airspace so you don’t have to wait. And you land anytime, you leave anytime. But it may be Marine One, because even post presidency, I may be able to round up a private plane sometime, but it’s tough not to have your helicopter waiting for you. <em>[laughs]</em></p>\n<p><strong>The last time I talked to you, you had one teenage daughter.</strong><br>\nNow I have two.</p>\n<p><strong>I’m two years away. Is it better, worse, or the same than what you expected when everybody told you, “Oh, just wait&#8212;just wait till they’re teenagers”?</strong><br>\nMy daughters are amazing girls. They’re smart, they’re funny. They take after their mom, and Michelle’s done a great job with them. You get these teenage moments&#8212;they love you, but what I think really affects you most is they just don’t have time for you. It’s not an active disdain for you. It’s just their calendars start filling up and they’ve got all\nthese friends who are much more interesting.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h2>The 14 Best Photos from the White House Flickr Account</h2>\n<div id=\"5646583ea3bd50211a99dc5a\" data-type=\"gallery\"></div><hr/>\n<p><strong>Yeah, you’re not the coolest person in their lives anymore.</strong><br>\nAnd you just have to let go, you have to acknowledge that if you say to them, “Hey, you want to go watch this movie?” or “Hey, you want to go take a swim at the pool?” “No, sorry, Daddy. I love you, though. See you tomorrow, ’cause I’m spending the night at somebody’s house.” The golden age is between, say, 6, 7, and 12, and they’re your buddies and they just want to hang out. And after that, they will love you, but they don’t have that much time for you. And my understanding is, based on friends of mine who have older kids, is that with a little bit of luck, as long as you’re not so completely annoying during these teenage years, they’ll come back to you around 23, 24, and actually want to hang out with you. But that stretch is painful. The compensation you get for the fact that they don’t have time for you is: Nothing beats watching your children become smarter and cooler than you are. And you suddenly will hear them say something or make a joke or have an insight and you go,\n“Wow.

bus tells you everything you need to know because the bus is a piece of shit. You would expect a Donald Trump campaign bus to be MOST LUXURIOUS, MOST DESIRED, NUMBER ONE BUS in the world, with a solid-gold chassis and marble toilets and a rooftop fuck cabana. This is not that bus. “It’s just a bus,” one Trump staffer told me, which is exactly right. It’s an old cross-country bus that still smells like an old cross-country bus, only it’s painted blue, with the name TRUMP in huge letters across both sides, plus the campaign hashtag <em>#Make America Great Again!</em> Trump says he has copyrighted it (“I’m using that a lot, and I think it’s a great statement”) even though you can’t actually put exclamation points or spaces in a hashtag.</p>\n<p>The bus is basically a rolling version of Trump’s Atlantic City: it’s built to look nice for a single day, then it falls into disrepair the moment you’ve stopped paying attention. From a distance, though, the bus looks like a monument. You see the name, and you take in everything that name connotes&#8212;wealth, ego, poor taste&#8212;and the bus has done its job. This is Trump’s bus, and it dominates the landscape the moment it arrives. People from all around take selfies near it. Why? Because TRUMP, that’s why.</p>\n<p>And the bus is working. Perhaps you’ve noticed&#8212;or perhaps you’re trying not to notice&#8212;but Donald Trump is leading all current Republican candidates in the national polls, and his lead is growing. And so it doesn’t really matter whether you see this as an alarming sign of the nation’s growing lunacy, or as a reckoning for a GOP that has been awash for years in hateful rhetoric, or as a byproduct of Trump’s masterful ability to hijack all political coverage by embracing his role as America’s Master Idiot. He’s doing it. At least for a brief moment, he’s winning. And he may extend his lead once the GOP debates begin Thursday night. Trump has managed to plaster his name all over this election as if it were one of his overpriced condos, and he has drawn the crowds as a result.</p>\n<p>And these are real voters out here who are responding to him: real voters who are lining up for his rallies in large numbers (not as large as Trump claims, but still!), real voters who hang on every word of his ridiculous pitch for how he will wheel and deal America back to the top.</p>\n<p>But who the fuck are these people? Are they blind? Are they crazy? Have they been brainwashed by all the giant signs? Or is it possible they see something in Trump that the rest of us don’t? What makes someone want to seriously consider voting for this man? I didn’t know what the answer was, but I wanted to see for myself. I needed to make it make sense. So I went to Iowa&#8212;Iowa: The State You Grew Up Swearing You’d Leave One Day!™&#8212;to meet them. And to see The Donald in the flesh.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Every election dispatch from Iowa is required to include a bit of scenery-setting, to show you just how folksy Iowa is: corn, state fairs, dragonflies, balloon museums, smiling fat babies, etc.</p>\n<p>This is not the Iowa I visited. The Donald Trump Make America Great Again Rally and Family Picnic was held in Oskaloosa, a small town 60 miles east of Des Moines. Oskaloosa is like a lot of small Midwestern towns right now: crumbling houses, shuttered businesses, half-empty strip malls.  You are surrounded by loss here. One of the few thriving businesses I saw in town, apart from a kickass bar called The Cellar Peanut Pub, was a video store. An actual video store. They didn’t even have to rent porn to stay solvent. They had customers, <em>and</em> they were hiring.</p>\n<p>Oskaloosa has been left behind in the Information Age. What has left here is never coming back, no matter what any politician or businessman promises. And people in Osky&#8212;the locals call it “Osky”&#8212;don’t look pleased about this. Contrary to friendly Midwestern stereotypes, they look PISSED. Every man I saw in town looked like your father-in-law the first time you met him at the door. Out on the empty roads, the only vehicles are big, angry pickup trucks with huge side mirrors sticking way out, like they wanna punch your car. People here are aggrieved. People here have had a lot of disappointment, and they are sick of it.</p>\n<p>Like Karen and Diane. Along with a bunch of friends and family, they showed up early this morning to the 696-seat George Daily Community Auditorium (which Oskaloosa’s middle school and high school share) so they could get as close to their billionaire savior as possible. To “see the color of his eyes,” Diane said. I greeted their group as they waited by the door, many of them sitting in nylon golf chairs, nervous about losing their spot in line.</p>\n<p>“I like that Trump won’t back down,” Karen told me. “He says what he means and he means what he’s saying. He ain’t going to say he’s sorry. Sometimes he likes to say things not politically correct, but they all better get used to that. The people who do speak politically correct have been losers.”</p>\n<p>“They constipated America!” Diane said, rocking a House of Blues t-shirt. “What we have had is politicians and lawyers who have constipated America. Let’s get a businessman in there and get things moving! We need our new MiraLAX!”</p>\n<p><em>Do you believe everything Trump says?</em></p>\n<p>“At this point, I’m inclined to say he’s not lying.”</p>\n<p><em>Do you think he exaggerates sometimes?</em></p>\n<p>“Oh yeah. Who doesn’t?”</p>\n<p>“He is for America,” Karen says. “He is for the elderly. He is for the quiet people.”</p>\n<p>Who are “<em>the quiet people</em>”?</p>\n<p>“The people like us, that a lot of times walk around with the attitude that, ‘Oh, it doesn’t matter what I think. I’m just from Osky.’ You know? <em>The quiet people</em>. The people who don’t think they have a voice.”</p>\n<p>Karen used to live in Arizona, where she had a job at a semiconductor plant, adding gold buttons to each chip in on anassembly line. But the plant was relocated to China, and so she lost her job and relocated here. As you could probably surmise, she likes Trump’s tough talk about foreigners stealing our jobs. I had arrived in Iowa just as Trump was doubling down on his comments that Mexico was sending “rapists” across our border; people here loved it, and seemed oddly emotional about the subject of immigration, even though Iowa is nowhere near the border. Apparently, it’s not just the immigrants from <em>Mexico</em> that concern Iowans for Trump. “We need to get the Muslims out of the country,” a man named Bob with a swirling white beard told me, “before they start killing our families!” Everyone around him nodded.</p>\n<p>The line to see Trump grew longer and stretched across the front of Oskaloosa middle school. A local Hy-Vee supermarket put up picnic tables and gave away bottled water, potato salad, pulled pork, and hot dogs thick as flashlights. Elderly people tooted around on Rascal scooters. An enterprising man hocked all-purpose GOP fanboy buttons with slogans like BENGHAZI MATTERS.</p>\n<p>I met an old couple wearing matching Trump t-shirts, which they told me they wore every day. “I haven’t had one bad comment on it,” said the wife. I met a man named Wayne who voted for Obama twice but was now firmly in Trump’s corner. I met ANOTHER man named Wayne who walked me carefully through his five-point rationale for why Trump was the best candidate. (Voters often show up at these rallies with little stump speeches of their own.) I met a woman named Jill who showed up with several hand-drawn signs. (My favorite was “Beltway Talks; Trump Works.”) Jill was <em>fired the fuck up</em> for some Trump in her life. I don’t know how it’s possible to be so fired up with the election so far away, but Jill was <em>blazing</em>. She wanted to make sure the whole world knew that Trump and his voters were for real.</p>\n<p>“I was terribly insulted when [John McCain] called us crazies,” Jill told me.</p>\n<p><em>What is it that you like so much about Trump?</em></p>\n<p>“He’s a capitalist,” Jill explained. “That inspires me.”</p>\n<p>I also ran into a very rare minority in the crowd&#8212;a Pakistani woman who emigrated here from Pakistan 40 years ago and didn’t like the idea of anyone skirting the naturalization process.</p>\n<p>“I came in the right way,” she told me. “When you try to do things the right way, it doesn’t work. And all these illegals sneaking in, and being able to stay&#8212;how do they get to do that?”</p>\n<p><em>And you think Trump will make things fairer</em>.</p>\n<p>“Well, as long as he does a better job than what’s being done. You know?”</p>\n<p>A nervous drug counselor named Tracy was also in line to see Trump. Unlike some of the others, she had some concerns about him. Well, one: “He’s an atheist,” she said.</p>\n<p>A man nearby overheard us talking and told us he shared her worry. “We have to elect godly men.”</p>\n<p>But Jill&#8212;the sign lady&#8212;cut into the conversation and came to the rescue: “He’s not an atheist. I wanted to correct that. He explained the church he’s gone to his whole life. He didn’t articulate it as well as he should have. But you know what? That articulation&#8212;I’m not concerned with that.”</p>\n<p>That seemed to cool Tracy’s hangups about Trump being a godless heathen.</p>\n<p>And I spotted a woman pushing around a stroller with a photograph of a live abortion taped to it, along with a big sign that read “DEAR PLANNED PARENTHOOD, I AM NOT FOR SALE.” For some reason, the woman ditched the stroller in the middle of the path leading to the auditorium, and a squat veteran named Randy went to alert the police. “That’s a good way to get a bomb brought in,” he said. While we all stared at the stroller, looking for any suspicious bulges (it turned out to be clean), Randy explained to me why he had a big ol’ Trump-on.</p>\n<p>“I like what he has to say. He won’t take no shit from nobody.”</p>\n<p><em>What’s your favorite thing he’s said?</em></p>\n<p>“You’re fired!”</p>\n<p><em>Who would you like him to fire, besides Obama?</em></p>\n<p>“Let’s see: John Kerry, our last governor, the attorney general, every Muslim that they put in…”</p>\n<p>Randy seemed untroubled by Trump’s lack of polish, or knowledge, or basic human grace. Far from it&#8212;these were virtues. “You don’t have to be a brain to run a business,” Randy said. “Just an ass. Sometimes you can be nice and polite, but there’s sometimes you’ve just got to be a horse’s ass with somebody to get them to do what they’re supposed to be doing.”</p>\n<p>So far, I’d heard Trump compared&#8212;favorably&#8212;to a horse’s ass and to a laxative, and I began to imagine a Trump campaign poster that was just a big horse’s butthole spewing hot diarrhea.</p>\n<p><em>So you believe Trump has the fearlessness to run this country?</em></p>\n<p>“I know he does,” said Randy. “Have you ever watched <em>The Apprentice?</em>”</p>\n<p>I talked to more voters and a pattern emerged in the answers. Trump was “honest,” “not PC,” “authentic,” “shooting from the hip,” and “called a spade a spade.” And of course, he wasn’t from Washington. He was gonna get in there and shake things up.</p>\n<p>We’ve heard all of this before, from many, many other candidates. Every presidential election has at least one magical, imaginary OUTSIDER&#8212;that teenage wet dream of a president who rides into Washington, tells those bureaucrats what shitheads they are, and bulldozes Congress into doing cool shit simply with the power of his huge cock. I have fallen for this kind of candidate. YOU have fallen for this kind of candidate. Everybody wants this mythical Bulworth to exist, but at this level of politics, there are no outsiders, and the game changes its rules for no one.</p>\n<p>And yet, people buy in. Maybe this time, they think, the guy who says he’s different really is different.</p>\n<p>And Trump, to his credit, is definitely different.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Noon was approaching and the doors to the auditorium opened. Trump supporters poured into seats in front of the stage and onto a set of risers behind the podium. The hated media&#8212;that would include me&#8212;sat toward the back.</p>\n<p>After a couple of introductory speeches from a local politician and a member of Seal Team Seven (not Six, but Seven&#8212;they’re one better!), we were greeted by former <em>Apprentice</em> runner-up Tana Goertz, who also happens to be Trump 2016’s Iowa co-chair and a “well-known Bedazzler spokeswoman.”</p>\n<p>“We all know how much Donald Trump is worth!” Goertz cried out, inaccurately. “How much?” The response from the crowd was messy and overlapping&#8212;many wild guesses called out at once.</p>\n<p>“I’ve met a lot of smart people,” Goertz continued, undaunted, “but I have never met a man that thinks about working when other people are talking about working.”</p>\n<p><em>Wait, what?</em></p>\n<p>“At the heart of it all, he’s a builder. Who better than Donald Trump to rebuild this country?”</p>\n<p>Okay, that’s a metaphor I can get behind.</p>\n<p>“You have never ever in your life experienced what you’re about to experience today. I’m just going to say: Sit back, put on your seatbelt. It’s going to be a fun ride. You will enjoy the experience and the ride, which is Donald Trump.”</p>\n<p>Finally&#8212;after a quick Pledge of Allegiance&#8212;the man himself emerged through a side door, carried aloft by the strains of Joe Esposito’s “You’re The Best.”</p>\n<p>I saw the hair first. It arrived in two parts: first the Turtle Wax-ed strands that run along both sides of his scalp, then the champagne glitter yarn kit perched top. I’d never seen Trump before, and the hair was all that I’d hoped for, and more. And after announcing his intention to molest all of Iowa’s chief export (“I want to grab that corn like you’ve never seen&#8212;so beautiful”) the ride started up.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>I’m gonna say a few nice things about Donald Trump now. If that terrifies you, then by all means, skim through this section and carry on with your existence.</p>\n<p>But I must tell you that, in person, Donald Trump is a very entertaining public speaker. And is this really such a surprise? Ever since* The Art of the Deal*, Trump has spent decades giving speeches all over the country, acting as our Get-Rich-Quick godfather. When he gets in front of a microphone, he requires no notes. No teleprompter. He is confident. He is casual. He is charming. Everyone is a “great guy” or an “amazing negotiator.”</p>\n<p>He can even be funny. When I texted a friend from the event that Trump was hilarious in person, he texted back, “NO. No no no.” Sorry, it’s true. It’s still not clear whether he’s in on the joke&#8212;there’s always been a bit of mystery to how aware Donald Trump is that Donald Trump is full of shit. But when you see him in person, and you hear him claim that the term “Supreme Leader” would be more fitting for him than for the head of Iran, there is the tiniest hint that he knows what a ludicrous thing this is to say. Even his exaggerations are hilarious. He said this was the biggest crowd in state history, even though we were in a public-school auditorium. He said he was worth more than $10 billion, a figure that is impossible for him to prove but also impossible for us to disprove. He said he made $213 million from <em>The Apprentice</em>, a figure which NBC steadfastly refutes.</p>\n<p>At one point, Trump boasted about how much veterans adore him. To prove it, he trotted out a gorgeous brunette who was carrying a perfect stack of white paper topped with a bow. I swear it looked like an unwrapped package of blank Hammermill printer paper. “In one day,” Trump blared, “many hundreds of letters from Vietnam vets, thanking me. This is from veterans. Each page, a different letter. It’s amazing.”</p>\n<p>Everyone ate it up. They laughed and cheered and hollered out in approval all through his speech.  It was more like a late-night monologue, and true to his reputation, Trump is not careful with his words. You can see why people think he’s more “honest” than one of the other randos in the GOP field&#8212;he’s gifted at not sounding like a politician even as he deploys standard tricks from the “I’m not a politician” handbook. He is definitely more fun to watch than Bobby Jindal. I wish there were more Trump-like candidates out there who are not Donald Trump, if that makes any sense.</p>\n<p>He also made a good point or two in between all the noise. At one point he bellowed: “I read Jeb Bush raised over a hundred million dollars. Now if you think that those people giving him all those money aren’t getting a lot, you’re wrong. All of these people are controlled by the people who gave them their money.” He’s right! It’s true! Holy shit, Donald Trump said a true thing. I heard it with my own two ears.</p>\n<p>If Donald Trump has one undeniable virtue as a politician, it’s that he does not try to fake being one of us. He’s not going to the fucking Bowl-o-Rama on a Saturday night in a plaid shirt to prove he’s a man of the people. The whole thrust of The Donald’s campaign is that he is special. He is extraordinary. In Osky, he compared his business acumen to Jack Nicklaus’ golfing ability and Babe Ruth’s hitting ability. (“It’s called talent. <em>Talent</em>.”) He is a WINNER, and he is here to help this nation of sad losers learn how to win again.</p>\n<p>“We don’t win anymore in this country,” he told the crowd. “When was the last time we won? When did we beat China in a deal? We don’t win.”</p>\n<p>Well, Trump is here to fix all that losing. And here is where my brief jag of mildly effusive praise for Donald Trump must come to an end, because the grim undercurrent of his rise is SHAME.  After all, if you believe we must make America great again, then you must also believe that America, at the present moment, sucks. And pretty much everyone at the Trump picnic believed that America sucks. When I asked a group of Trump supporters outside if they were proud of America, they all laughed with derision. <em>Of course</em> they weren’t proud of America. Of course this nation is a shithole. One voter named Corey told me he hoped Trump would help America “get back to the way it was,” a refrain I heard from a lot of people, as if the country was a rock band that had changed its sound. Backing Trump means acknowledging that you live in a world of failure, and that your last best hope is the Music Man moseying into town.</p>\n<p>Now, here is how Donald Trump says he will Make America Great Again™. In Trump’s worldview, politics is little more than series of deals to be made. Every complex global problem, or intractable adversary, can be tamed with sufficiently hard-ass steakhouse dealmaking. He explained it all in Osky:</p>\n<p>“I know the greatest negotiators in the world,” he said. “Now some of these people are horrible human beings. You wouldn’t have them to dinner. They’re vicious. They’re crude. They’re unhappy. They treat everybody badly. Who cares? I want them negotiating against China. Think of Carl Icahn, a friend of mine. He’d be great. I’d say, ‘Carl, take China’.”</p>\n<p>Now, people applauded this, which alarmed me because (A) Who has friends like this? And (B) Sending a vicious, crude, unhappy person who treats everyone badly to go yell FUCK YOU at the Chinese strikes me as unwise.</p>\n<p>But Trump is so certain, so supremely confident, that everyone at his rallies go for the idea anyway. It comes off as an act of counterintuitive genius. What’s not to like about the idea that you can fix everything by just marching into Washington and yelling at all the dummies to stop being dummies? I wish politics were that simple. I really do. Politics <em>should</em> be that simple. Trump’s gift is that he really can make it sound that easy, even when it’s all a huge lie. His swagger is <em>your</em> swagger. He can reduce entire countries down to a cardboard persona. He’ll get tough with Mexico. He’ll have Carl take China. The way Trump explains it, you’d think China had only one person in it.</p>\n<p>Trump is so certain of his horseshit that, on that stage in Osky, he laid out a remarkable future scenario of him in the Oval Office that was essentially one enormous lie that hasn’t had the chance to become a lie yet. Here now is what President Trump would do if Ford tried to build a manufacturing plant down in Mexico:</p>\n<p>“It’s so easy. <em>It’s too easy</em>. I do it with a phone call. I call the head of Ford, and I say, ‘Every single car and truck that comes into the US, we’re going to tax you 35 percent’.”</p>\n<p>Massive applause! Trump wasn’t done.</p>\n<p>“So this isn’t 99.9 percent&#8212;this is <em>one hundred percent</em> what’s going to happen: He’ll call me back, probably that afternoon, but he may play it tough and call me back the next day. The next day I’ll get a call from Ben Ford”&#8212;NOTE: there is no Ben Ford; I assume he meant Bill&#8212;“and he’ll say, ‘Mr. President, we decided not to build that plant. We’ll build it in the United States.’”</p>\n<p>And everyone in the joint bought it! They damn near broke their hands clapping for this idea! I almost bought it myself! At least, I did for half a second before I thought, <em>Wait, don’t you need Congress to approve shit like that? And wouldn’t forcing the plant to be built here increase the cost of Fords? And then wouldn’t people stop buying Fords? And then wouldn’t Ford go belly up, costing us even MORE jobs than if we had just left the goddamn plant in Mexico? And what about the many, many Fords that are already produced in Mexico?</em></p>\n<p>But a Trump rally isn’t about thinking more than half a second ahead. There is a first BOLD step, and then you are left to assume that everything else will fall neatly into place. In Trump’s white-trash, Louis XIV universe, all you see is the pretty gold paint before it starts chipping off the walls.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Money, ironically, is what will likely wind up being Trump’s political downfall. Once the primary field has been winnowed down to a few schlubs, the GOP establishment will dump its funds into a single candidate with the goal of overtaking Trump, whom they all despise. (Yet one more reason why voters here love him, by the way.) And as rich Trump may claim to be, there are limits to how much of his personal fortune he’ll spend on this effort.</p>\n<p>Once the GOP muscles him out, Trump may very well run a third-party campaign that divides conservative voters and all but hands the 2016 election to a waiting Hillary Clinton. In Osky, this was every thinking Trump voter’s nightmare scenario. “As long as he doesn’t split parties, I’m there,” one attendee told me. “If he does that, it’s too important of an election.” But it could happen. And if it does, Trump may go from the darling of far-right conservatives voters to their most-hated nemesis.</p>\n<p>At the end of Trump’s speech, “We’re Not Gonna Take It” by Twisted Sister boomed through the speakers and played him off the stage.  The crowd grave him a standing O on his way out. The ride was over. The reviews outside were glowing: “Awesome.” “I loved his demeanor.” “Solutions.” “It’s nice to hear somebody talk who’s not a politician.” They were all sold. They were all going to home to preach the gospel of their King Midas.</p>\n<p>As I watched everyone file out, I thought of a moment during Tana Goertz’s opening-act speech earlier in the day, when she pleaded with everyone to eat more of the food outside. “Mr. Trump can’t take all this food home on the plane,” she told us. “There’s not enough room.” And so as all of Trump’s energized constituents filed out of the joint, I pictured him getting onto his plane, cigar in the corner of his mouth, jetting back to the Land of Winners. And I pictured everyone else stuck back here in Osky, with nothing but the scraps he left behind for all the quiet people.</p>","categories":{"channels":[{"id":"59b038ed0a8d2f0976474f19","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Culture","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"culture"}],"famous-people":[{"id":"59b038eddd663e6940cf1605","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"}],"topics":[{"id":"59b038ed7246eb56980ac830","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Election","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"election"},{"id":"59b038ecf667492236d9173f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Politics","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"politics"}]},"channel":"News & Culture","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"558285b9e52bc4b477a968a5","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","name":"Drew Magary","socialMedia":[{"network":"Twitter","handle":"@drewmagary"}]}]},"dek":"America is constipated, says one Trump supporter&#8212;and The Donald?

bus tells you everything you need to know because the bus is a piece of shit. You would expect a Donald Trump campaign bus to be MOST LUXURIOUS, MOST DESIRED, NUMBER ONE BUS in the world, with a solid-gold chassis and marble toilets and a rooftop fuck cabana. This is not that bus. “It’s just a bus,” one Trump staffer told me, which is exactly right. It’s an old cross-country bus that still smells like an old cross-country bus, only it’s painted blue, with the name TRUMP in huge letters across both sides, plus the campaign hashtag *#Make America Great Again!* Trump says he has copyrighted it (“I’m using that a lot, and I think it’s a great statement”) even though you can’t actually put exclamation points or spaces in a hashtag. \n\nThe bus is basically a rolling version of Trump’s Atlantic City: it’s built to look nice for a single day, then it falls into disrepair the moment you’ve stopped paying attention. From a distance, though, the bus looks like a monument. You see the name, and you take in everything that name connotes—wealth, ego, poor taste—and the bus has done its job. This is Trump’s bus, and it dominates the landscape the moment it arrives. People from all around take selfies near it. Why? Because TRUMP, that’s why.\n\n+++feature-small\n\n[#article: /articles/56b8fb71b89407780bd7bd8d]||||||\n\n+++\n\nAnd the bus is working. Perhaps you’ve noticed—or perhaps you’re trying not to notice—but Donald Trump is leading all current Republican candidates in the national polls, and his lead is growing. And so it doesn’t really matter whether you see this as an alarming sign of the nation’s growing lunacy, or as a reckoning for a GOP that has been awash for years in hateful rhetoric, or as a byproduct of Trump’s masterful ability to hijack all political coverage by embracing his role as America’s Master Idiot. He’s doing it. At least for a brief moment, he’s winning. And he may extend his lead once the GOP debates begin Thursday night. Trump has managed to plaster his name all over this election as if it were one of his overpriced condos, and he has drawn the crowds as a result. \n\nAnd these are real voters out here who are responding to him: real voters who are lining up for his rallies in large numbers (not as large as Trump claims, but still!), real voters who hang on every word of his ridiculous pitch for how he will wheel and deal America back to the top.\n\nBut who the fuck are these people? Are they blind? Are they crazy? Have they been brainwashed by all the giant signs? Or is it possible they see something in Trump that the rest of us don’t? What makes someone want to seriously consider voting for this man? I didn’t know what the answer was, but I wanted to see for myself. I needed to make it make sense. So I went to Iowa—Iowa: The State You Grew Up Swearing You’d Leave One Day!™—to meet them. And to see The Donald in the flesh. \n\n----------\n\nEvery election dispatch from Iowa is required to include a bit of scenery-setting, to show you just how folksy Iowa is: corn, state fairs, dragonflies, balloon museums, smiling fat babies, etc. \n\nThis is not the Iowa I visited. The Donald Trump Make America Great Again Rally and Family Picnic was held in Oskaloosa, a small town 60 miles east of Des Moines. Oskaloosa is like a lot of small Midwestern towns right now: crumbling houses, shuttered businesses, half-empty strip malls.  You are surrounded by loss here. One of the few thriving businesses I saw in town, apart from a kickass bar called The Cellar Peanut Pub, was a video store. An actual video store. They didn’t even have to rent porn to stay solvent. They had customers, *and* they were hiring.\n\nOskaloosa has been left behind in the Information Age. What has left here is never coming back, no matter what any politician or businessman promises. And people in Osky—the locals call it “Osky”—don’t look pleased about this. Contrary to friendly Midwestern stereotypes, they look PISSED. Every man I saw in town looked like your father-in-law the first time you met him at the door. Out on the empty roads, the only vehicles are big, angry pickup trucks with huge side mirrors sticking way out, like they wanna punch your car. People here are aggrieved. People here have had a lot of disappointment, and they are sick of it.\n\nLike Karen and Diane. Along with a bunch of friends and family, they showed up early this morning to the 696-seat George Daily Community Auditorium (which Oskaloosa’s middle school and high school share) so they could get as close to their billionaire savior as possible. To “see the color of his eyes,” Diane said. I greeted their group as they waited by the door, many of them sitting in nylon golf chairs, nervous about losing their spot in line.\n\n“I like that Trump won’t back down,” Karen told me. “He says what he means and he means what he’s saying. He ain’t going to say he’s sorry. Sometimes he likes to say things not politically correct, but they all better get used to that. The people who do speak politically correct have been losers.” \n\n“They constipated America!” Diane said, rocking a House of Blues t-shirt. “What we have had is politicians and lawyers who have constipated America. Let’s get a businessman in there and get things moving! We need our new MiraLAX!”\n\n*Do you believe everything Trump says?* \n\n“At this point, I’m inclined to say he’s not lying.” \n\n*Do you think he exaggerates sometimes?*\n\n“Oh yeah. Who doesn’t?”\n\n“He is for America,” Karen says. “He is for the elderly. He is for the quiet people.”\n\nWho are “*the quiet people*”?\n\n“The people like us, that a lot of times walk around with the attitude that, ‘Oh, it doesn’t matter what I think. I’m just from Osky.’ You know? *The quiet people*. The people who don’t think they have a voice.”\n\nKaren used to live in Arizona, where she had a job at a semiconductor plant, adding gold buttons to each chip in on anassembly line. But the plant was relocated to China, and so she lost her job and relocated here. As you could probably surmise, she likes Trump’s tough talk about foreigners stealing our jobs. I had arrived in Iowa just as Trump was doubling down on his comments that Mexico was sending “rapists” across our border; people here loved it, and seemed oddly emotional about the subject of immigration, even though Iowa is nowhere near the border. Apparently, it’s not just the immigrants from *Mexico* that concern Iowans for Trump. “We need to get the Muslims out of the country,” a man named Bob with a swirling white beard told me, “before they start killing our families!” Everyone around him nodded.\n\nThe line to see Trump grew longer and stretched across the front of Oskaloosa middle school. A local Hy-Vee supermarket put up picnic tables and gave away bottled water, potato salad, pulled pork, and hot dogs thick as flashlights. Elderly people tooted around on Rascal scooters. An enterprising man hocked all-purpose GOP fanboy buttons with slogans like BENGHAZI MATTERS. \n\nI met an old couple wearing matching Trump t-shirts, which they told me they wore every day. “I haven’t had one bad comment on it,” said the wife. I met a man named Wayne who voted for Obama twice but was now firmly in Trump’s corner. I met ANOTHER man named Wayne who walked me carefully through his five-point rationale for why Trump was the best candidate. (Voters often show up at these rallies with little stump speeches of their own.) I met a woman named Jill who showed up with several hand-drawn signs. (My favorite was “Beltway Talks; Trump Works.”) Jill was *fired the fuck up* for some Trump in her life. I don’t know how it’s possible to be so fired up with the election so far away, but Jill was *blazing*. She wanted to make sure the whole world knew that Trump and his voters were for real.\n\n“I was terribly insulted when [John McCain] called us crazies,” Jill told me.\n\n*What is it that you like so much about Trump?*\n\n“He’s a capitalist,” Jill explained. “That inspires me.”\n\nI also ran into a very rare minority in the crowd—a Pakistani woman who emigrated here from Pakistan 40 years ago and didn’t like the idea of anyone skirting the naturalization process. \n\n“I came in the right way,” she told me. “When you try to do things the right way, it doesn’t work. And all these illegals sneaking in, and being able to stay—how do they get to do that?”\n\n*And you think Trump will make things fairer*.\n\n“Well, as long as he does a better job than what’s being done. You know?”\n\nA nervous drug counselor named Tracy was also in line to see Trump. Unlike some of the others, she had some concerns about him. Well, one: “He’s an atheist,” she said.\n\nA man nearby overheard us talking and told us he shared her worry. “We have to elect godly men.”\n\nBut Jill—the sign lady—cut into the conversation and came to the rescue: “He’s not an atheist. I wanted to correct that. He explained the church he’s gone to his whole life. He didn’t articulate it as well as he should have. But you know what? That articulation—I’m not concerned with that.”\n\nThat seemed to cool Tracy’s hangups about Trump being a godless heathen.\n\nAnd I spotted a woman pushing around a stroller with a photograph of a live abortion taped to it, along with a big sign that read “DEAR PLANNED PARENTHOOD, I AM NOT FOR SALE.” For some reason, the woman ditched the stroller in the middle of the path leading to the auditorium, and a squat veteran named Randy went to alert the police. “That’s a good way to get a bomb brought in,” he said. While we all stared at the stroller, looking for any suspicious bulges (it turned out to be clean), Randy explained to me why he had a big ol’ Trump-on.\n\n“I like what he has to say. He won’t take no shit from nobody.”\n\n*What’s your favorite thing he’s said?* \n\n“You’re fired!”\n\n*Who would you like him to fire, besides Obama?*\n\n“Let’s see: John Kerry, our last governor, the attorney general, every Muslim that they put in…”\n\nRandy seemed untroubled by Trump’s lack of polish, or knowledge, or basic human grace. Far from it—these were virtues. “You don’t have to be a brain to run a business,” Randy said. “Just an ass. Sometimes you can be nice and polite, but there’s sometimes you’ve just got to be a horse’s ass with somebody to get them to do what they’re supposed to be doing.”\n\nSo far, I’d heard Trump compared—favorably—to a horse’s ass and to a laxative, and I began to imagine a Trump campaign poster that was just a big horse’s butthole spewing hot diarrhea.\n\n*So you believe Trump has the fearlessness to run this country?*\n\n“I know he does,” said Randy. “Have you ever watched *The Apprentice?*”\n\nI talked to more voters and a pattern emerged in the answers. Trump was “honest,” “not PC,” “authentic,” “shooting from the hip,” and “called a spade a spade.” And of course, he wasn’t from Washington. He was gonna get in there and shake things up. \n\nWe’ve heard all of this before, from many, many other candidates. Every presidential election has at least one magical, imaginary OUTSIDER—that teenage wet dream of a president who rides into Washington, tells those bureaucrats what shitheads they are, and bulldozes Congress into doing cool shit simply with the power of his huge cock. I have fallen for this kind of candidate. YOU have fallen for this kind of candidate. Everybody wants this mythical Bulworth to exist, but at this level of politics, there are no outsiders, and the game changes its rules for no one.\n\nAnd yet, people buy in. Maybe this time, they think, the guy who says he’s different really is different. \n\nAnd Trump, to his credit, is definitely different.\n\n----------\n\nNoon was approaching and the doors to the auditorium opened. Trump supporters poured into seats in front of the stage and onto a set of risers behind the podium. The hated media—that would include me—sat toward the back. \n\nAfter a couple of introductory speeches from a local politician and a member of Seal Team Seven (not Six, but Seven—they’re one better!), we were greeted by former *Apprentice* runner-up Tana Goertz, who also happens to be Trump 2016’s Iowa co-chair and a “well-known Bedazzler spokeswoman.”\n\n“We all know how much Donald Trump is worth!” Goertz cried out, inaccurately. “How much?” The response from the crowd was messy and overlapping—many wild guesses called out at once.\n\n“I’ve met a lot of smart people,” Goertz continued, undaunted, “but I have never met a man that thinks about working when other people are talking about working.”\n\n*Wait, what?*\n\n“At the heart of it all, he’s a builder. Who better than Donald Trump to rebuild this country?”\n\nOkay, that’s a metaphor I can get behind. \n\n“You have never ever in your life experienced what you’re about to experience today. I’m just going to say: Sit back, put on your seatbelt. It’s going to be a fun ride. You will enjoy the experience and the ride, which is Donald Trump.”\n\nFinally—after a quick Pledge of Allegiance—the man himself emerged through a side door, carried aloft by the strains of Joe Esposito’s “You’re The Best.” \n\nI saw the hair first. It arrived in two parts: first the Turtle Wax-ed strands that run along both sides of his scalp, then the champagne glitter yarn kit perched top. I’d never seen Trump before, and the hair was all that I’d hoped for, and more. And after announcing his intention to molest all of Iowa’s chief export (“I want to grab that corn like you’ve never seen—so beautiful”) the ride started up.\n\n\n----------\n\n\nI’m gonna say a few nice things about Donald Trump now. If that terrifies you, then by all means, skim through this section and carry on with your existence.\n\nBut I must tell you that, in person, Donald Trump is a very entertaining public speaker. And is this really such a surprise? Ever since* The Art of the Deal*, Trump has spent decades giving speeches all over the country, acting as our Get-Rich-Quick godfather. When he gets in front of a microphone, he requires no notes. No teleprompter. He is confident. He is casual. He is charming. Everyone is a “great guy” or an “amazing negotiator.”\t \n\nHe can even be funny. When I texted a friend from the event that Trump was hilarious in person, he texted back, “NO. No no no.” Sorry, it’s true. It’s still not clear whether he’s in on the joke—there’s always been a bit of mystery to how aware Donald Trump is that Donald Trump is full of shit. But when you see him in person, and you hear him claim that the term “Supreme Leader” would be more fitting for him than for the head of Iran, there is the tiniest hint that he knows what a ludicrous thing this is to say. Even his exaggerations are hilarious. He said this was the biggest crowd in state history, even though we were in a public-school auditorium. He said he was worth more than $10 billion, a figure that is impossible for him to prove but also impossible for us to disprove. He said he made $213 million from *The Apprentice*, a figure which NBC steadfastly refutes.\n\nAt one point, Trump boasted about how much veterans adore him. To prove it, he trotted out a gorgeous brunette who was carrying a perfect stack of white paper topped with a bow. I swear it looked like an unwrapped package of blank Hammermill printer paper. “In one day,” Trump blared, “many hundreds of letters from Vietnam vets, thanking me. This is from veterans. Each page, a different letter. It’s amazing.” \n\nEveryone ate it up. They laughed and cheered and hollered out in approval all through his speech.  It was more like a late-night monologue, and true to his reputation, Trump is not careful with his words. You can see why people think he’s more “honest” than one of the other randos in the GOP field—he’s gifted at not sounding like a politician even as he deploys standard tricks from the “I’m not a politician” handbook. He is definitely more fun to watch than Bobby Jindal. I wish there were more Trump-like candidates out there who are not Donald Trump, if that makes any sense.\n\nHe also made a good point or two in between all the noise. At one point he bellowed: “I read Jeb Bush raised over a hundred million dollars. Now if you think that those people giving him all those money aren’t getting a lot, you’re wrong. All of these people are controlled by the people who gave them their money.” He’s right! It’s true! Holy shit, Donald Trump said a true thing. I heard it with my own two ears. \n\nIf Donald Trump has one undeniable virtue as a politician, it’s that he does not try to fake being one of us. He’s not going to the fucking Bowl-o-Rama on a Saturday night in a plaid shirt to prove he’s a man of the people. The whole thrust of The Donald’s campaign is that he is special. He is extraordinary. In Osky, he compared his business acumen to Jack Nicklaus’ golfing ability and Babe Ruth’s hitting ability. (“It’s called talent. *Talent*.”) He is a WINNER, and he is here to help this nation of sad losers learn how to win again. \n\n“We don’t win anymore in this country,” he told the crowd. “When was the last time we won? When did we beat China in a deal? We don’t win.”\n\nWell, Trump is here to fix all that losing. And here is where my brief jag of mildly effusive praise for Donald Trump must come to an end, because the grim undercurrent of his rise is SHAME.  After all, if you believe we must make America great again, then you must also believe that America, at the present moment, sucks. And pretty much everyone at the Trump picnic believed that America sucks. When I asked a group of Trump supporters outside if they were proud of America, they all laughed with derision. *Of course* they weren’t proud of America. Of course this nation is a shithole. One voter named Corey told me he hoped Trump would help America “get back to the way it was,” a refrain I heard from a lot of people, as if the country was a rock band that had changed its sound. Backing Trump means acknowledging that you live in a world of failure, and that your last best hope is the Music Man moseying into town.\n\nNow, here is how Donald Trump says he will Make America Great Again™. In Trump’s worldview, politics is little more than series of deals to be made. Every complex global problem, or intractable adversary, can be tamed with sufficiently hard-ass steakhouse dealmaking. He explained it all in Osky:\n\n“I know the greatest negotiators in the world,” he said. “Now some of these people are horrible human beings. You wouldn’t have them to dinner. They’re vicious. They’re crude. They’re unhappy. They treat everybody badly. Who cares? I want them negotiating against China. Think of Carl Icahn, a friend of mine. He’d be great. I’d say, ‘Carl, take China’.”\n\nNow, people applauded this, which alarmed me because (A) Who has friends like this? And (B) Sending a vicious, crude, unhappy person who treats everyone badly to go yell FUCK YOU at the Chinese strikes me as unwise. \n\nBut Trump is so certain, so supremely confident, that everyone at his rallies go for the idea anyway. It comes off as an act of counterintuitive genius. What’s not to like about the idea that you can fix everything by just marching into Washington and yelling at all the dummies to stop being dummies? I wish politics were that simple. I really do. Politics *should* be that simple. Trump’s gift is that he really can make it sound that easy, even when it’s all a huge lie. His swagger is *your* swagger. He can reduce entire countries down to a cardboard persona. He’ll get tough with Mexico. He’ll have Carl take China. The way Trump explains it, you’d think China had only one person in it.\n\nTrump is so certain of his horseshit that, on that stage in Osky, he laid out a remarkable future scenario of him in the Oval Office that was essentially one enormous lie that hasn’t had the chance to become a lie yet. Here now is what President Trump would do if Ford tried to build a manufacturing plant down in Mexico:\n\n“It’s so easy. *It’s too easy*. I do it with a phone call. I call the head of Ford, and I say, ‘Every single car and truck that comes into the US, we’re going to tax you 35 percent’.”\n\nMassive applause! Trump wasn’t done.\n\n“So this isn’t 99.9 percent—this is *one hundred percent* what’s going to happen: He’ll call me back, probably that afternoon, but he may play it tough and call me back the next day. The next day I’ll get a call from Ben Ford”—NOTE: there is no Ben Ford; I assume he meant Bill—“and he’ll say, ‘Mr. President, we decided not to build that plant. We’ll build it in the United States.’” \n\nAnd everyone in the joint bought it! They damn near broke their hands clapping for this idea! I almost bought it myself! At least, I did for half a second before I thought, *Wait, don’t you need Congress to approve shit like that? And wouldn’t forcing the plant to be built here increase the cost of Fords? And then wouldn’t people stop buying Fords? And then wouldn’t Ford go belly up, costing us even MORE jobs than if we had just left the goddamn plant in Mexico? And what about the many, many Fords that are already produced in Mexico?*\n\nBut a Trump rally isn’t about thinking more than half a second ahead. There is a first BOLD step, and then you are left to assume that everything else will fall neatly into place. In Trump’s white-trash, Louis XIV universe, all you see is the pretty gold paint before it starts chipping off the walls. \n\n\n----------\n\n\nMoney, ironically, is what will likely wind up being Trump’s political downfall. Once the primary field has been winnowed down to a few schlubs, the GOP establishment will dump its funds into a single candidate with the goal of overtaking Trump, whom they all despise. (Yet one more reason why voters here love him, by the way.) And as rich Trump may claim to be, there are limits to how much of his personal fortune he’ll spend on this effort. \n\nOnce the GOP muscles him out, Trump may very well run a third-party campaign that divides conservative voters and all but hands the 2016 election to a waiting Hillary Clinton. In Osky, this was every thinking Trump voter’s nightmare scenario. “As long as he doesn’t split parties, I’m there,” one attendee told me. “If he does that, it’s too important of an election.” But it could happen. And if it does, Trump may go from the darling of far-right conservatives voters to their most-hated nemesis.\n\nAt the end of Trump’s speech, “We’re Not Gonna Take It” by Twisted Sister boomed through the speakers and played him off the stage.  The crowd grave him a standing O on his way out. The ride was over. The reviews outside were glowing: “Awesome.” “I loved his demeanor.” “Solutions.” “It’s nice to hear somebody talk who’s not a politician.” They were all sold. They were all going to home to preach the gospel of their King Midas.\n\nAs I watched everyone file out, I thought of a moment during Tana Goertz’s opening-act speech earlier in the day, when she pleaded with everyone to eat more of the food outside. “Mr. Trump can’t take all this food home on the plane,” she told us. “There’s not enough room.” And so as all of Trump’s energized constituents filed out of the joint, I pictured him getting onto his plane, cigar in the corner of his mouth, jetting back to the Land of Winners. And I pictured everyone else stuck back here in Osky, with nothing but the scraps he left behind for all the quiet people.","channel":"News & Culture","subChannel":"Politics","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"identifiable":true,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"revisionAuthor":"Freddie Campion","issueDate":"","hed":"What Kind of Person Would Vote For Donald Trump?

He couldn’t always harness it. He couldn’t stop trying to win everyone over, whether it was a *60 Minutes* correspondent, 500 powerful donors in a crowded banquet hall, or a fetching woman on a rope line.\n\n\nIf Clinton acted like someone who ran Capitol Records, Obama—both the person *and* the president—carries himself like Roger Federer, a merciless competitor who keeps coming and coming, only there’s a serenity about him that\ndisarms just about everyone. At one point during the hour I spent interviewing him at the White House this fall, he casually compared himself to Aaron Rodgers, and he wasn’t bragging. Obama identified with Rodgers’s ability to keep his focus downfield despite all the chaos happening in front of him. That’s Obama’s enduring quality,\nand (to borrow another sports term) this has been his “career year.”\n\n+++inset-right\n\n[#image: /photos/56461af26ff00fb522b08a6a]||||||\n\n+++\n\n\nObama lives in America’s most famous museum and uses it to his advantage. You’re sitting there in some ancient tearoom waiting for him to show up, surrounded by portraits of former first ladies and framed maps from battles\nthat America won over the centuries. Everyone is friendly but suspicious. Everyone talks in hushed tones. You feel like you’re intruding at all times. You’re just…waiting. Suddenly, ten anonymous security guards pop out of hallways\nand doorways that you didn’t know were there. The energy shifts. And then, there’s Obama—big smile, big handshake, some ball-busting comments to put everyone at ease. Within seconds of greeting me, he was poking fun at my shoes and teasing me for not writing anymore.\n\n\n“It’s really aggravating not having you on Grantland,” he said, almost like I betrayed him. “I go to the site and there’s no Simmons. Come on, man, it’s not the same.”  \n\n+++aside\n\n> “It’s really aggravating not having you on Grantland,” he said, almost like I betrayed him. “I go to the site and there’s no Simmons. Come on, man, it’s not the same.”\n\n+++\n\n\nIt’s an alpha-male trick—put someone off-balance, flatter them and bust their chops at the same time. A few minutes later, he was grabbing control of the interview with measured responses, knowing that he didn’t have to perform\nwithout cameras or podcast equipment. And so he took his time. And it worked. I mean, how do you interrupt the most powerful man on earth? It felt like the way Federer repeatedly jumped Novak Djokovic’s second serve in the 2015 U.S. Open Final—a savvy trick to disrupt someone’s flow, a seemingly harmless way to gain an edge. It’s what the great competitors do.\n\nIn January, Obama will begin his eighth and final year on the job. It’s an *era* now. What has he learned about leadership? What was his biggest regret? Why did it seem like, in 2015, he finally started letting it fly, threw on his Beefsquatch costume and let everyone know “THIS IS ME NOW!” Gay marriage, health care, Charleston, the Iran deal… If you voted against him, 2015 was the year when his inner confidence bothered you more than ever. And if you voted for him, 2015 was definitely the year when you said, “*That* is the guy I voted for.” But what if Barack Obama has been that guy all along?\n\n\n----------\n\n\n__BILL SIMMONS: If you could go back to 2008 and tell yourself one thing, what would it be?__\n\n__BARACK OBAMA:__ “You’re going to be busy.” Coming in, we were going through an unprecedented economic upheaval, combined with an upheaval in the Middle East that we hadn’t seen in our lifetimes. There was going\nto be a huge amount of disruption. I would probably tell myself to communicate more effectively early on than I did. We ran a great campaign. It wasn’t as great as it seems in retrospect—there’s always rose-colored glasses but there’s no doubt that we captured the country’s imagination. And somehow in those first two years, I think a certain arrogance crept in, in the sense of thinking as long as we get the policy ready, we didn’t have to sell it.\n\nOne thing I learned through some tough election cycles: You can’t separate good policy from the need to bring the American people along and make sure that they know why you’re doing what you’re doing. And that’s particularly\ntrue now in this new communications era. I think that we were ahead of the curve in 2008 in social media and the Internet and digital communications. When we came into office, instead of taking some of those lessons, we\nsuddenly adapted ourselves to the White House press room and structures that had been built back in the 1940s and ’50s. As a consequence of those missteps early, we got the policies right, and that’s why the economy now has grown for five and a half straight years, six years, and why unemployment rates have gone from 10 percent to 5.1 percent. But there was a lot of political pain along the way that might not have been necessary.\n\n\n__Was there a point in those first three years where you started to feel overwhelmed by the job? Where you\nwere just like, “My God, I just had no idea this was going to be this hard!”__  \nI had a pretty good handle. One thing I learned during the campaign was that I’ve got a good temperament. I don’t get too high and I don’t get too low. I’m able to stay focused even when there’s a lot of stuff going on around me.\n\n+++aside\n\n[#image: /photos/564a559f2d2b323920e38094]||||||\n\n+++\n\n__So you’re like Gregg Popovich. Although he does get mad at sideline reporters.__  \n*[laughs]* He does. So do I. *[laughs]* Yeah. Or maybe [Aaron] Rodgers in the pocket, in the sense of you can’t be distracted by what’s around you, you’ve got to be looking downfield. And I think that’s a quality that I have—not getting flustered in what’s around me. So there was never a point, even early on—even in the first six months, where we weren’t sure whether we were going to dip into another Great Depression, we weren’t sure whether the steps we were taking on rescuing the auto industry or stabilizing the financial system were going to work—there weren’t moments where I thought, “Sheesh, feels like we’re in over our head.”\n\nBut what I didn’t fully appreciate, and nobody can appreciate until they’re in the position, is how decentralized power is in this system. When you’re in the seat and you’re seeing the housing market collapse and you are seeing unemployment skyrocketing and you have a sense of what the right thing to do is, then you realize, “Okay, not only do I have to persuade my own party, not only do I have to prevent the other party from blocking what the right thing to do is, but now I can anticipate this lawsuit, this lobbying taking place, and this federal agency that technically is independent, so I can’t tell them what to do. I’ve got the Federal Reserve, and I’m hoping that they do the right thing—and by the way, since the economy now is global, I’ve got to make sure that the Europeans, the Asians, the Chinese, everybody is on board.” A lot of the work is not just identifying the right policy but now constantly building these ever shifting coalitions to be able to actually implement and execute and get it done. \n\n+++inset-right\n\n[#article: /articles/563a3466df121979786a2025]||||||\n\n+++\n\n\n__You’re out to dinner with your wife and the phone rings. How many of the people in your life are you like, “Uh-oh, I’ve got to take this”?__  \nMalia and Sasha. *[laughs]* And maybe my mother-in-law. My national security adviser, Susan Rice, and Denis McDonough, my chief of staff. Those are the only people whose call I would take during a date night with Michelle. But the entire White House is full of people who have enormous responsibilities. You can’t do this by yourself. The principle of team building in the White House is really no different than the principle of team building anywhere, on a sports team or a well-run business. Do they put team ahead of themselves? Do you make sure all the pieces fit together? Because just having the best athletes, if they’re knocking heads and nobody’s doing rebounding and everybody wants the ball, it isn’t always going to work.\n\n__Is it fair to say that in 2015, you’ve been like the second-semester high school senior who got into Yale and now is like, “I’m going out tonight—I don’t care if I have a test tomorrow”? All of us were kind of waiting for that guy to show up after he got re-elected. What took two years to get there?__  \nThere’s no doubt that the longer I’m in this job, the more confident I am about the decisions I’m making and more knowledgeable about the responses I can expect. And as a consequence, you end up being looser. There’s not much I have not seen at this point, and I know what to expect, and I can anticipate more than I did before.\n\nI [also] have a case to make now that was harder to make earlier in my presidency. We had confidence, for example, that the economic decisions that we made to stabilize the financial system and pass Wall Street reform and raise\ntaxes on the wealthiest and pass health care—that would have a payoff. But because we had been in such a deep hole, we had to be careful about crowing success when people weren’t feeling it. And it wasn’t really until around 2014 where the attitude of the American people was, “The economy’s improving, I’m feeling better.”\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#image: /photos/564247813cc8fcfe0e19fd2f]||||||\n\n+++\n\n\n__So you feed off that.__  \nYou can make your case without caveats, which, I think, hampered my ability to communicate confidence and optimism to people. You didn’t want people to feel as if you were getting ahead of yourself. It’s a combination of me feeling looser because I’ve just been in this job a long time and have gone through some tough stretches. Not only do you not look like you have any fear, but you actually *don’t* have any fear. And I don’t at this point. The bets we made early on have paid off. Some of it does have to do with luck. \n\nThink about 2013, right after I’d been re-elected: Our goal was to lead with a big push on immigration reform. And then, before the second inauguration has even happened, [the school shooting at] Sandy Hook happens. Which remains, by the way, the worst few days of my presidency. I went up and visited with those families and—you know, Bill, you’ve still got small kids. These are 6-year-olds, right? And you have 20 of them who’ve been massacred. Right away, our focus had to shift to “Is there a way for us to capture this moment to see if we can get over this incredible hump to try to put in place some common-sense gun-safety rules?” And we knew it was a stretch, just because of the politics of Congress and the NRA. But we had to try. \n\nAnd throughout 2013 and 2014, you had a series of events like that—the Snowden disclosures, Ebola, Ferguson, ISIL, and unaccompanied children coming across the borders—all sort of stacked up in a row. None of them individually unsolvable, but given the 24/7 news cycle, they just sort of pile up on each other. Even though, in the midst of this, the economy is improving and we are making real progress on education and health care and energy and so forth, political momentum turns sharply against you. And so we’ve had more than our share of stormy seas, but we’ve navigated the ship well.\n\n\n__When Ferguson happened last year, I was waiting for Obama the Person to come in. But you had to be President Obama. How you handled Charleston this year and Selma—that was Obama the Person. So what happened with Ferguson? Do you wish you had handled that differently?__  \nYou know, the challenge of Ferguson and all issues related to police shootings, race, and the criminal-justice system is that in order to actually get something done, you have to build consensus. Expressing simple outrage without\nfollow-up is often counterproductive. In the case of Ferguson, I’m the attorney general’s boss. If I chime in with a strong opinion about what’s happened, not only do I stand to potentially damage subsequent law-enforcement cases, but immediately you get blowback and backlash that may make people less open to listening. What was different in Charleston was the clarity of what happened—that allowed, I think, everybody to be open to it.\n\n+++inset-right\n\n> “The fact that race has always been the fault line of our society and has always distorted our politics—that is not subject to argument. Part of what you’re looking for is a way not to just vent but to actually move the people.”\n\n+++\n\n\n__Did it take time during the presidency to realize what kind of moments those were?__  \nYes, sometimes it’s feel. Sometimes the circumstances won’t give you a clean statement. The fact that race has always been the fault line of our society and has always distorted our politics—that is not subject to argument. Part of what you’re looking for is a way not to just vent but to actually move the people. I practiced law for a while—a lot of times, hard cases can make bad law. If you have an issue that you want to put forward, you’re looking for the right plaintiff and the right court to appear before. I do think as you go on as president, you get a better feel for this, but you’re not always going to be perfect. When the Trayvon Martin case happened, I had an honest response as a father that I think resonated with a lot of people. When Ferguson happened, there was a gap between how quickly we could pull together a police task force, recommendations. And so in that lag, it feels as if I haven’t spoken to the moment as effectively. I suspect that if I were to do it over again, there might be something I could say that would’ve crystallized it more effectively. But Ferguson—the case itself was tougher because people didn’t know what was going on exactly. In some ways the [Eric] Garner case in New York was clearer because you had on videotape exactly what had happened, and some of the subsequent cases have been more obvious.\n\n+++aside\n\n[#image: /photos/564a559d85e6a68d29af5edd]||||||\n\n+++\n\nOne thing you learn as president is you’re not always going to perform flawlessly and you have to be able to put that out of your mind and then look at the next problem coming down the pipe. If I’m working out in the gym, sometimes I’ll go to NBA Classics and watch some of these old classic games—\n\n__The lack of HD really hurts—you can barely see anybody.__  \nIt’s true—and the graphics at the bottom are terrible. But a thing that you’re reminded of, watching those old Bulls games, is Jordan had some stinker games in the playoffs. But he would get that out of his mind, and then the next moment comes and he’s right there. He could have a terrible game for the first three quarters and then suddenly go crazy the fourth. Or he might miss a free throw, and then the next play is he’s stealing the ball and hitting the game-winning shot. Part of what I try to do—not at the level that Jordan did on the basketball court, but part of what you aspire to as president or any of these positions of leadership—is to try to figure out how to be in the moment, make the best decision you can, know that you’re going to get a bunch of them right, but a bunch of times you’re also not going to get it exactly the way you want it.\n\n__You win the election in 2008, and Twitter is just becoming a thing. Over the course of your presidency, that’s the biggest thing that’s changed. What’s the biggest challenge with all that stuff?__  \nSpeed. You are on 24/7—you have to respond immediately. The job of our office, to keep up and to respond quickly to anything that’s happening but not be consumed by it, is completely different. We’ve been building a digital team inside the White House. \n\n__When did that start?__  \nToo late. That’s an example of something that I would’ve started earlier. That was a lesson that coming out of the first term, I should’ve understood. That’s why we built this team. It’s so interesting watching my daughters. Both are complete ninjas on the phone, right? And they can do things that I don’t even understand—they’re doing it in two seconds. But I even see a difference between Malia, who’s 17, and Sasha, who’s 14. There’s almost a mini-generational gap in terms of Sasha being so connected seamlessly to this smartphone in a way that Malia, who was already a little bit older when it really started to take, is not. \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#image: /photos/56436afea3bd50211a99c42d]||||||\n\n+++\n\n\n__The ability to multitask with 19 different friends at the same time…__  \nYeah. And just the degree to which her social life is so connected to that. So it’s not just having to change how we do business inside the White House to react to stories, but also, how do we tell a story about issues to constituencies that are completely splintered, who don’t watch television in the same way, who don’t watch the news in the same way? In some ways we’re just laying the foundation for what I assume will be the standard practice of future presidents. \n\n__Gun control: You’ve tried to legislate it as much as you possibly could and hit a wall basically in every direction. But the one thing Hillary Clinton has brought up is executive action.__  \nWell, keep in mind that after Sandy Hook, we put forward 23 executive actions. So we haven’t been asleep at the switch in terms of executive actions that we’ve tried. There are maybe a few more that had to be scrubbed by lawyers because, essentially, with every executive action, we can count on it being challenged by somebody in Congress or, in this case, the NRA. We want to make any executive action we take as defensible as possible legally. In the absence of a movement politically in which people say, “Enough is enough,” we’re going to continue to see, unfortunately, these tragedies take place. The main thing that I’ve been trying to communicate over the last several of these horrific episodes is that, contrary to popular belief, Americans are not more violent than people in other developed countries. But they have more deadly weapons to act out their rage, and that’s the only main variable that you see between the U.S. and these other countries. \n\n__It does feel like it’s going to become the dominant issue of year eight.__  \nI hope so. We have this weird habit in this culture of mourning and, you know, 48, 72 hours of wall-to-wall coverage, and then…suddenly we move on. And I will do everything I can to make sure that there’s a sustained attention paid to this thing. \n\n__What’s the most entertaining conspiracy theory you ever read about yourself?__  \nThat military exercises we were doing in Texas were designed to begin martial law so that I could usurp the Constitution and stay in power longer. Anybody who thinks I could get away with telling Michelle I’m going to be president any longer than eight years does not know my wife.\n\n+++inset-right\n\n[#image: /photos/56424783a3bd50211a99bd4d]||||||\n\n+++\n\n\n__Have you ever said, “Give me the JFK-assassination files, I want to read them. Give me all the secret stuff”?__  \nI gotta tell you, it’s a little disappointing. People always ask me about Roswell and the aliens and UFOs, and it turns out the stuff going on that’s top secret isn’t nearly as exciting as you expect. In this day and age, it’s not as top secret as you’d think.\n\n__Would you ever want to be a Supreme Court justice?__  \n*[pauses]*\n\n__You paused!__  \nNo—well, the reason I paused for a second was just to make sure that I let people know that I think good judges are really important, and Supreme Court justices, obviously, are hugely important. I don’t have the temperament to sit in relative solitude and just opine and write from the bench. I want to be in the action a little bit more. \n\n__Is it true you have a virtual driving range in the White House?__  \nTrue.\n\n__It’s in the bowels of the White House?__  \nYeah, I mean, this is not like some super-fancy thing. But I can hit these Wiffle balls.\n\n__So you go down there and hit, like as a stress reliever?__  \nYeah. Just whack ’em. Whack ’em around a little bit.\n\n__Has anyone come to the White House and picked up your older daughter for a date?__  \nNo, but I’ve seen some folks glancing at her in ways that made me not happy.\n\n+++aside\n\n[#image: /photos/564cb6fc28d382f252281a7c]|||__[Subscribe to GQ](https://subscribe.gq.com/subscribe/gq/96554)__|||\n\n+++\n\n__Tell the Secret Service, “Just take out that guy over there”?__  \n“Just keep an eye on him.”\n\n__Does it scare you that your wife could have a billion-dollar daytime talk show and you could be Stedman 2.0?__  \n*[laughs]* Uh…\n\n\n__Because that’s in play.

I do love *Game of Thrones*.\n\n\n__Which character do you identify with?__  \nMy favorite character is probably…the dwarf, what’s his name?\n\n__Oh, yeah. Peter Dinklage’s character.__  \nThe problem with *Game of Thrones,* though, is that I don’t remember the names of any of the characters.\n\n__I don’t, either.__  \nI remember the characters, so when I watch it, I know exactly what’s going on. But if you read a review of the show afterwards and they’re mentioning such and such, the only one I remember is Jon Snow, because I can pronounce Jon Snow.\n\n__Which *Game of Thrones* character is Donald Trump?__  \nUh…I don’t think…I don’t think any of them rise to that level.\n\n__If you were campaigning against Trump, would you even bother? Would it be like LaBradford Smith talking trash to Jordan or something?__  \nI would’ve enjoyed campaigning against Trump. That would’ve been fun.\n\n__Which leadership style suits your vision of where America should go forward? Biden or Hillary?__  \n*[laughs]* Come on, Bill.\n\n+++aside\n\n\n[#image: /photos/564a559c85e6a68d29af5ed9]||||||\n\n+++\n\n\n__I had to ask you one thing you can’t answer! Here’s one you have to answer: Who’s more untradable, Derrick Rose or Jay Cutler?__  \n*[pause]* Oh, I think Rose still has more upside. Remember, Rose is still awfully young.\n\n\n__So you haven’t given up on Rose?__  \nI’ve not given up on him. Sadly, I think it’s hard to imagine, after that many injuries, him getting back to his MVP-season performance. But he can still be a top-ten point guard.\n\n\n\n__Baseball, football, basketball, all the commissioner jobs open up next year. Which one would you want?__  \nWell, I’m best suited for basketball. But I cannot believe that the commissioner of football gets paid\n$44 million a year. \n\n__When you said, “I cannot believe…,” I didn’t know where you were going with that. Have you thought about calling [Roger Goodell](https://www.gq.com/story/roger-goodell-season-from-hell) and being like, “What are you *doing?* Can I help you?” [*Obama laughs*.] “Can I give you some advice? Want to have dinner?”__  \nThey’re making a profit, and I think that’s what the owners are most concerned with.\n\n+++inset-right\n\n[#image: /photos/56424783a3bd50211a99bd51]||||||\n\n+++\n\n\n__So you think the owners like having him there?__  \nYou’re not going to drag me into your fights, man. Come on—I’ve got enough fights of my own. *[laughs]* This is between you and Roger.\n\n__Number of cigarettes you’ve smoked in the White House since you got here?__  \nZero in the last five years. I made a promise that once health care passed, I would never have a cigarette again. And I have not.\n\n\n__What perk of being president are you going to miss the most?__  \nSo the clear answer would be Air Force One: an amazing plane with an amazing crew, they clear out airspace so you don’t have to wait. And you land anytime, you leave anytime. But it may be Marine One, because even post presidency, I may be able to round up a private plane sometime, but it’s tough not to have your helicopter waiting for you. *[laughs]*\n\n__The last time I talked to you, you had one teenage daughter.__  \nNow I have two.\n\n__I’m two years away. Is it better, worse, or the same than what you expected when everybody told you, “Oh, just wait—just wait till they’re teenagers”?__  \nMy daughters are amazing girls. They’re smart, they’re funny. They take after their mom, and Michelle’s done a great job with them. You get these teenage moments—they love you, but what I think really affects you most is they just don’t have time for you. It’s not an active disdain for you. It’s just their calendars start filling up and they’ve got all\nthese friends who are much more interesting.\n\n\n----------\n\nThe 14 Best Photos from the White House Flickr Account\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n[#gallery: /galleries/5646583ea3bd50211a99dc5a]||||||\n\n----------\n\n__Yeah, you’re not the coolest person in their lives anymore.__  \nAnd you just have to let go, you have to acknowledge that if you say to them, “Hey, you want to go watch this movie?” or “Hey, you want to go take a swim at the pool?” “No, sorry, Daddy. I love you, though. See you tomorrow, ’cause I’m spending the night at somebody’s house.” The golden age is between, say, 6, 7, and 12, and they’re your buddies and they just want to hang out. And after that, they will love you, but they don’t have that much time for you. And my understanding is, based on friends of mine who have older kids, is that with a little bit of luck, as long as you’re not so completely annoying during these teenage years, they’ll come back to you around 23, 24, and actually want to hang out with you. But that stretch is painful. The compensation you get for the fact that they don’t have time for you is: Nothing beats watching your children become smarter and cooler than you are. And you suddenly will hear them say something or make a joke or have an insight and you go, \n“Wow. I didn’t think of that.”\n\n\n__Are they ready for you to be the ex-president?__  \nNot as much as Michelle, but certainly ready.\n\n__Oh, Michelle’s the leader of the power rankings?__  \nOh, absolutely. There are clear rankings. Michelle. Malia and Sasha, they’re constantly wrestling for second place. I rank ahead of the dogs.\n\n+++inline-video\n\n[#cnevideo: /cnevideos/564a654a64b2c22534d56e6a]||||||\n\n+++\n\n----------\n\n\n__Bill Simmons__ *is the founder of Grantland, the co-creator of

quite&#8212;immune to parody. Throughout a year in which he has had some strange and deep effect on American politics, he has done a number of interviews here at his desk on the twenty-sixth floor of Trump Tower, Central Park stretching out in the distance behind him. Many of these encounters relay the same Trumpian idiosyncrasies&#8212;the way he always has impressive hot-off-the-press poll data to share, for instance, or the pleasure he takes in showing off the packed wall of Donald Trump magazine covers going back over 30 years (“cheaper than wallpaper,” he told <em>60 Minutes</em>), or the hyperbolic descriptions of his lifetime achievements.</p>\n</div><p>And no matter how many articles make note of these habits, or try to lampoon them, he&#39;s not giving them up. As I enter his office and take a seat at the opposite side of his desk&#8212;I don&#39;t offer a handshake, nor does he&#8212;he immediately hands me a sheet of paper. “Okay, that&#39;s for you,” he says warmly. “Nice poll. Just came out.” Between us, lined up along the front of his desk, are stacks of all of the recent magazines with his face on the cover&#8212;<em>Rolling Stone, Time, People, Newsweek, New York,</em> multiple copies of each, as though as an additional sideline he has opened the world&#39;s most narrowly focused newsstand.</p>\n<p>As I settle in, his 27-year-old communications director, Hope Hicks, informs him that an article they have been expecting for a while about his time in military school has just been published.</p>\n<div class=\"embed callout-embed-component inset-right \" data-type=\"callout\"><div class=\"embed pullquote \" data-type=\"pullquote\"><span class=\"pullquote-content\"><blockquote>\n<p>“Are we gonna be the cover story, do you know? Or not? We should be,\nwe should be. Based on merit, we should be. But we&#39;ll see. Not\nsure I want it. You&#39;re going to ask a positive question before the\ninterview&#39;s over, right?”</p>\n</blockquote></span></div></div><p>“Good or bad?” he asks.</p>\n<p>“Great,” she says.</p>\n<p>“ ‘Good athlete,’ all that stuff?” he checks.</p>\n<p>“ ‘Best athlete’…‘ladies’ man&#39;…,” she says.</p>\n<p>“Really?” he says, clearly pleased.</p>\n<p>“…‘best student’…,” she continues.</p>\n<p>“Yeah, I was a great student,” he says in a meditative tone. “I was good at everything.”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, that&#39;s what they said,” she confirms.</p>\n<p>He asks her to give a copy to me. (As it happens, I&#39;ve already read it online this morning; Ms. Hicks&#39;s summary is accurate.) “That&#39;s nice, huh?” he muses, and tells her he needs to write to his old classmates. “I heard they have some really nice quotes, and I haven&#39;t seen them in a long time.” He turns to me. “We get older, Chris, right? That&#39;s the bad part.”</p>\n<p>I entered the room using a cane, and he now asks, quite kindly and gently, a few questions about my problematic ankle. I tell him that it&#39;s pretty much fine now, though not what it once was.</p>\n<p>“Well, hey, what is?” he says. “Anyway, go ahead.”</p>\n<p>The conversation that follows&#8212;he makes clear at several points&#8212;isn&#39;t always to Trump&#39;s liking. At times I think his affront may be tactical, a way to better control the situation, but just as often he seems genuinely perplexed and annoyed that someone like him, a nice guy who is trying to give his best to the American people and who is riding high in every early poll, who is giving up his Monday lunchtime to share his considerable charm, should be asked to explain himself like this. In these moments, I have to remind myself of the remarkable and extensive catalog of incendiary comments he has made, and positions he has taken, as he has blitzkrieged the ill-prepared and undefended barricades of the American political process.</p>\n<p>But I start by discussing a small personal peculiarity.</p>\n<p><strong>GQ: You don&#39;t shake hands, do you? (1)</strong><br>\n<strong>DONALD TRUMP:</strong> Oh yeah, no, I do shake hands. Well, I&#39;ve been saying, and it&#39;s been borne out…if you have a cold, you pass the cold along to other people, or a flu. But no, I shake hands very gladly politically. I don&#39;t think you could be a politician if you didn&#39;t shake hands. Can you imagine if I refused to shake anybody&#39;s hands? <em>[“No,” chimes in Ms. Hicks, who will be remaining here for our interview.]</em> No&#8212;bottom line, I shake hands.</p>\n<div class=\"embed callout-embed-component aside \" data-type=\"callout\"><p><strong>1.</strong> In his 1997 book, <em>The Art of the Comeback,</em> in a chapter incidentally titled “The Press and Other Germs,” he spells out his philosophy on this issue most fully. “One of the curses of American society is the simple act of shaking hands,” he begins.</p>\n</div><p><strong>But if you go the whole way, you&#39;re going to have to touch a lot of dirty hands between now and next November.</strong><br>\nI&#39;ve been doing it. <em>[Ms. Hicks: “He&#39;s been doing it. Thirty thousand people at a rally the other week&#8212;he shook a lot of hands.”]</em> I&#39;ve been shaking thousands and thousands of hands on a daily basis, actually.</p>\n<p><strong>Does it make you shiver a little bit inside?</strong><br>\nNo, it&#39;s part of what I have to do to make America great again.</p>\n<p><strong>Are you having fun?</strong><br>\nI&#39;m having a good time. Because of the success of it, perhaps. It makes it a lot easier than some people that are not doing well. But I&#39;ve <em>really</em> enjoyed it. I really have.</p>\n<p><strong>Many years ago you said, “The fun is in the getting, not the having,” and I guess some people wonder whether that&#39;s your attitude toward the presidency.</strong><br>\nNo, actually in this case I don&#39;t think there&#39;s fun involved. It will be constant work to turn the country around because we have 50 million people on welfare, we have tremendous poverty levels at record numbers. We have almost a hundred million people out of work, out of the workforce. (2)</p>\n<div class=\"embed callout-embed-component aside \" data-type=\"callout\"><p><strong>2.</strong> Officially, there are actually 7.9 million unemployed people in America.</p>\n</div><p><strong>Putting it in the most basic way, there&#39;s a lot of people who really like you, but there&#39;s a lot of people who are deeply skeptical of your motives. Some people think it&#39;s a campaign driven by egotism, aimless ambition, and arrogance.</strong><br>\n<em>[slightly indignant half laugh]</em> This doesn&#39;t sound like a nice question! Look, I just have one thing in mind, and that&#39;s doing a great job for the country. Everybody has their detractors. Some people say arrogance, or whatever they may say. I only have one thing in mind and that&#39;s doing a great job for the country.</p>\n<p><strong>Whenever you explain why you&#39;d be a very fine president, a lot of what you say seems to boil down to: <em>Look, just shut up and trust me&#8212;I&#39;d be really good at this. I know I would.</em></strong><br>\nWell, I have been issuing a lot of policy over the last two-week period. But there is a certain amount of truth to that. I mean, I&#39;ve had tremendous success, and I&#39;ve just done it. And a lot of my supporters agree with that.</p>\n<p><strong>You&#39;ve broken many of the rules of how candidates usually act....</strong><br>\nThat&#39;s true. That, I agree with you. They say there&#39;s never been anything like this.</p>\n<p><strong>For instance, in recent times you&#39;ve referred to other people as: a loser, a total loser, a massive loser, grotesque, a moron, an obvious moron, a spoiled brat, a totally incompetent jerk, a stiff, a dummy, a bimbo, a clown, a low-class slob, a perv sleazebag, a major sleaze and buffoon, a spoiled brat without a properly functioning brain, a goofball atheist, a dope, a dummy dope, a dopey clown, a dog, and so on.</strong><br>\nWell, other people have said a lot of things about things, too. They&#39;ve said plenty of bad stuff.</p>\n<p><strong>But you&#39;ve got a vocabulary and an approach that&#39;s different.</strong><br>\nProbably. Probably that&#39;s why people are here, that&#39;s why I have this, you know. <em>[He gestures to the stacks of magazines lying between us.]</em> Every magazine cover. And maybe we&#39;ll have another. Are we gonna be the cover story, do you know? Or not? We should be, we should be. Based on merit, we should be. But we&#39;ll see. Not sure I want it. You&#39;re going to ask a positive question before the interview&#39;s over, right?</p>\n<p><strong>Well, I think the positive comes from the answer. Anyway, will you still talk like that if you&#39;re president?</strong><br>\nNo. Probably not.</p>\n<p><strong>Why not?</strong><br>\nDepends. It depends. I think probably I&#39;d be much different. I have a great capacity to be what I have to be, and as president you may want a different tone. But that&#39;s a highly competitive tone, and many of those expressions&#8212;not all, but many of those expressions&#8212;are highly descriptive. It&#39;s hard to find words to compete with them when talking about somebody. But no, I would imagine I would be quite a bit different. I would feel differently about things as a president. Right now, I&#39;m fighting a lot of people. As a president I would be more measured.</p>\n<p><strong>But part of your appeal, and part of what you&#39;re selling as your appeal, is that you&#39;re different. And if people are going to vote for you, surely they want the real Donald Trump to be the president?</strong><br>\nYeah, I would be. I wouldn&#39;t change much, but I think I would probably tone down the rhetoric, perhaps. And perhaps not. Depends on who it was that I was speaking about. We have some bad dudes out there.</p>\n<p><strong>If anyone attacks you, you bite back pretty hard, don&#39;t you?</strong><br>\nYes. Yes.</p>\n<p><strong>If you were the same kind of president as you are a candidate, it sometimes feels like the first time some country disrespected you, you&#39;d just want to nuke them.</strong><br>\nNo, no, no. But some of these countries are really taking advantage of us and I would fight for fairness of our country.</p>\n<p><strong>But would you be scared to nuke them if you thought it was justified?</strong><br>\nI wouldn&#39;t be nuking anybody.</p>\n<p><strong>Under any circumstances?</strong><br>\nUnder… I will have a military that&#39;s so strong and powerful, and so respected, we&#39;re not gonna have to nuke anybody.</p>\n<p><strong>So could we get rid of the weapons?</strong><br>\nNo, no, we wouldn&#39;t get rid of the weapons. Because you have so many people out there. But I would be somebody that would be amazingly calm under pressure.</p>\n<p><strong>But if you&#39;re not going to use them, what&#39;s the point in having them?</strong><br>\nThe fact that other people have them. And unfortunately gaining more and more.</p>\n<p><strong>But ultimately you have to be prepared to press the button or there&#39;s no point in having them?</strong><br>\nWell, I don&#39;t want to talk about that subject because that&#39;s not a subject that, you know… <em>[restarts his thought]</em> that has to do with that whole… <em>[restarts his thought again]</em> I just don&#39;t want to talk about it. It is highly, highly, highly, highly unlikely that I would ever be using them.</p>\n<p><strong>As you know, people ask a lot of questions about your attitude toward women. When you were asked on <em>The View</em> what your message was to women and you said you wanted to cherish them, protect them,</strong> take care of them&#8212;<br>\nAnd respect them, yes. I do respect them, I have great respect for women. In fact, one of the reasons <em>The Apprentice</em> was such a successful show for so many years, the audience of women was fantastic.</p>\n<p><strong>Sure, but that&#39;s an entertainment TV show.</strong><br>\nNo, but it&#39;s indicative. I have great respect for women, and I will do more for women than anybody because I get things done and I know how to do things. And I&#39;ll also keep this country safe and secure, which a politician probably won&#39;t, because they&#39;re weak and ineffective. They&#39;re weak, ineffective people, politicians.</p>\n<p><strong>What do you say to the women who respond: I&#39;m not that bothered about being “cherished” or “protected” or “taken care of,” I just want to be treated equally?</strong><br>\nI think you&#39;re being politically correct when you ask me a question like that. They do want to be taken care of and they do want to be cherished and they do want to be respected, and I think when you ask a question like that you&#39;re just trying to be politically correct, that&#39;s all. But that&#39;s okay.</p>\n<p><strong>You&#39;d never say you were going to “cherish” men, would you?</strong><br>\nI would. I would. I would cherish men. I cherish all people in their lives. I think it&#39;s very important. No, I would cherish men, I would cherish women&#8212;I want to take care of everybody.</p>\n<p><strong>Obviously another issue that some people have taken&#8212;</strong><br>\n<em>[interrupts]</em> Did anybody ever say anything positive about me? This is not looking... This is not looking good. So far I haven&#39;t been asked one positive question. But that&#39;s okay. Whatever. Whatever. <em>[exhales loudly through pursed lips]</em></p>\n<p><strong>People expect you to be asked tough questions, and you&#39;re certainly up to answering them.</strong><br>\nSure I am, but, I mean, you know, so far, in all fairness, you&#39;ve only asked me, like, really negative questions. Wow. I&#39;m saying, this article&#39;s going to be a disaster. <em>[Ms. Hicks: “I think we deserve the cover just for tolerating these questions.”]</em> It&#39;s all right. Whatever.</p>\n<p><strong>A similar issue that people are giving you a hard time about is race.</strong><br>\nI don&#39;t think so. Race? Nobody&#39;s giving me a hard time. I just won… I just had the highest percentage ever in a Republican primary&#8212;25 percent of the African-Americans supported me. (3) So I don&#39;t think you&#39;re right.</p>\n<p><strong>But certainly a lot of people have written, and some people suspect, that even if you&#39;re not racist yourself, you&#39;re consciously pandering to racist sentiments in parts of the electorate.</strong><br>\n<em>[Ms. Hicks to Trump: “Shall we wrap this up?”]</em> I&#39;ve never heard that. Yeah, well, I&#39;ve never heard that. No, I mean I am the least racist person that you have ever met.</p>\n<div class=\"embed callout-embed-component aside \" data-type=\"callout\"><p><strong>3</strong>. He is presumably referring to an opinion poll of voting intentions. Not a single vote has yet been cast, for Donald Trump or any other candidate, in this year&#39;s Republican primaries.</p>\n</div><p><strong>Obviously there&#39;s a big movement, the Black Lives Matter movement…</strong><br>\nI don&#39;t know&#8212;is it a big movement? I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s big or if it&#39;s small.</p>\n<p><strong>What do you make of it?</strong><br>\nI don&#39;t make anything of it. I saw them steal the microphone from Bernie Sanders and he just yielded, which surprised me. But no, I don&#39;t know anything about… You know, when you say it&#39;s a big movement, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a big movement. You think it&#39;s a big movement?</p>\n<p><strong>It&#39;s very hard to quantify. It&#39;s certainly a loud movement. And I think it&#39;s an interesting and important idea.</strong><br>\nYou think it is, actually? Black lives matter? But do you think white lives matter?</p>\n<p><strong>Well, the more common response is for people to say “all lives matter,” though I understand why some people consider that kind of tone-deaf.</strong><br>\nTo me, all lives matter. All lives matter.</p>\n<p><strong>But can you see how people who are fighting to point out a particular injustice&#8212;</strong><br>\n<em>[interrupts]</em> No. No, I can&#39;t. I can&#39;t understand that term, no. I think that term is hurting them, not helping them.</p>\n<p><strong>As you know, there&#39;s a lot of chatter that if the going gets tough and you go down in the polls, people think you&#39;ll just quit.</strong><br>\nThere is? I haven&#39;t…</p>\n<div class=\"embed callout-embed-component inset-right \" data-type=\"callout\"><p><strong>4</strong>. It was Trump who had fueled the subject four days earlier: When CNBC had asked him whether he would exit the race if he were no longer leading the polls, he replied, “Well, I&#39;m not a masochist.… If I fell behind badly, I would certainly get out.” Inevitably other TV interviewers followed up, and he repeated variations of the “I&#39;m not a masochist” line, perhaps until he realized that it was giving an unproductive impression. Hence yesterday&#39;s tweet: <em>I&#39;m leading by big margins in every poll but the press keeps asking, would you ever get out? They are just troublemakers, I&#39;m going to win!</em></p>\n</div><p><strong>You tweeted about it yesterday. (4)</strong><br>\nYeah, I mean sure, but when you say a lot of chatter, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a lot of chatter. Let&#39;s put it this way: I&#39;m in this to win this. I&#39;m not in to play games, I&#39;m not in to come in second and have everybody say how brilliant I was, and how it was the Summer of Trump&#8212;and even now the Autumn of Trump, because I&#39;m doing very well still. The summer ended a while ago.</p>\n<p><strong>I was listening to your call-in to <em>Fox and Friends Weekend</em> yesterday morning, talking about the sketch about you that opened the new season of <em>Saturday Night Live.</em> And you said that the only thing you took issue with was the wig, right?</strong><br>\nOh, terrible. It is my hair, by the way, as you know. As you can probably tell. Yeah, I thought the wig was terrible. I thought everything was fine, (5) but I thought the wig was terrible. It was just so cheap-looking to me. I&#39;d like them to get a much better-looking head of hair on the guy.</p>\n<div class=\"embed callout-embed-component aside \" data-type=\"callout\"><p><strong>5</strong>. Among the things their fake Trump said: “I love Megyn Kelly, I love her, I think she&#39;s great. She&#39;s talented and beautiful…but she&#39;s a heifer who&#39;s always on her period and I hate her and I hope she dies”; “Mexicans are stealing our children.”</p>\n</div><p><strong>I guess people have been fascinated by your hair for many, many, many years. Do you understand why that is?</strong><br>\nIf you look at the way I combed it up there <em>[he gestures toward his photo gallery]</em>, I mean, it&#39;s similar, right? You know, all these years. I&#39;m a very consistent person. Amazingly consistent person. You know, it is mine. You can follow my record pictorially&#8212;look, see those magazines. It&#39;s all the same haircut, right? You know, it&#39;s sort of funny. But I&#39;ve been combing it this way for a long time, I figure I better not stop.</p>\n<p><strong>Why do you favor such an unusual style?</strong><br>\nI don&#39;t think it&#39;s that unusual. <em>[Ms. Hicks: “No.”]</em> I don&#39;t know. To me, it&#39;s not that unusual. It&#39;s not unusual because it&#39;s the way I&#39;ve been combing it for a long time, since I&#39;m in school.</p>\n<p><strong>It is unusual the way it goes forward and backward.</strong><br>\nNo, it&#39;s not really forward and it&#39;s not really… You know, if you look you know it&#39;s not actually a comb-over.</p>\n<p><strong>I guess people are interested in it now because they think it&#39;s a sign of a sort of vanity.</strong><br>\nVanity? Sure. Maybe it is, maybe it isn&#39;t. I don&#39;t know, I don&#39;t think of it. <em>[Ms. Hicks: “Everybody combs their hair, right?”]</em></p>\n<p><strong>A lot of it is because&#8212;and I don&#39;t believe this to be the case but&#8212;people don&#39;t think there&#39;s really hair there.</strong><br>\nWell, I mean, can you see it? I mean, I actually have a hairline. <em>[He lifts up the front mass so that I can see a distinct, very regular line of hairs stretching upward from the front of his scalp; I gesture that he doesn&#39;t need to do this.]</em> I actually think only the haters&#8212;they know it&#39;s real but they say it&#39;s not. There are haters that say “it&#39;s not his” because they&#39;re haters&#8212;it&#39;s what they do.</p>\n<p><strong>You&#39;ve explained how you used to praise people who are now political enemies, or people you&#39;re competing with, like Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush, (6) by…</strong><br>\nI was a businessman, and I had to get along with everybody.

He has praised both many times over the years. For instance, in his 2000 book, <em>The America We Deserve,</em> Clinton is characterized as “smart and resilient,” and as for Bush: “Jeb Bush is a good man.… He&#39;s exactly the kind of political leader this country needs right now and will very much need in the future.… He&#39;s bright, tough and principled.” The point I will never get to make was that his position regarding these previous compliments (and associated campaign contributions) effectively is: <em>You should trust me now, because look how honest and up-front I am about how I&#39;ve had to be dishonest when it suited me.</em></p>\n<p><strong>7</strong>.

He couldn’t always harness it. He couldn’t stop trying to win everyone over, whether it was a <em>60 Minutes</em> correspondent, 500 powerful donors in a crowded banquet hall, or a fetching woman on a rope line.</p>\n<p>If Clinton acted like someone who ran Capitol Records, Obama&#8212;both the person <em>and</em> the president&#8212;carries himself like Roger Federer, a merciless competitor who keeps coming and coming, only there’s a serenity about him that\ndisarms just about everyone. At one point during the hour I spent interviewing him at the White House this fall, he casually compared himself to Aaron Rodgers, and he wasn’t bragging. Obama identified with Rodgers’s ability to keep his focus downfield despite all the chaos happening in front of him. That’s Obama’s enduring quality,\nand (to borrow another sports term) this has been his “career year.”</p>\n<p>Obama lives in America’s most famous museum and uses it to his advantage. You’re sitting there in some ancient tearoom waiting for him to show up, surrounded by portraits of former first ladies and framed maps from battles\nthat America won over the centuries. Everyone is friendly but suspicious. Everyone talks in hushed tones. You feel like you’re intruding at all times. You’re just…waiting. Suddenly, ten anonymous security guards pop out of hallways\nand doorways that you didn’t know were there. The energy shifts. And then, there’s Obama&#8212;big smile, big handshake, some ball-busting comments to put everyone at ease. Within seconds of greeting me, he was poking fun at my shoes and teasing me for not writing anymore.</p>\n<p>“It’s really aggravating not having you on Grantland,” he said, almost like I betrayed him. “I go to the site and there’s no Simmons. Come on, man, it’s not the same.”</p>\n<div class=\"embed callout-embed-component aside \" data-type=\"callout\"><div class=\"embed pullquote \" data-type=\"pullquote\"><span class=\"pullquote-content\"><blockquote>\n<p>“It’s really aggravating not having you on Grantland,” he said, almost like I betrayed him. “I go to the site and there’s no Simmons. Come on, man, it’s not the same.”</p>\n</blockquote></span></div></div><p>It’s an alpha-male trick&#8212;put someone off-balance, flatter them and bust their chops at the same time. A few minutes later, he was grabbing control of the interview with measured responses, knowing that he didn’t have to perform\nwithout cameras or podcast equipment. And so he took his time. And it worked. I mean, how do you interrupt the most powerful man on earth? It felt like the way Federer repeatedly jumped Novak Djokovic’s second serve in the 2015 U.S. Open Final&#8212;a savvy trick to disrupt someone’s flow, a seemingly harmless way to gain an edge. It’s what the great competitors do.</p>\n<p>In January, Obama will begin his eighth and final year on the job. It’s an <em>era</em> now. What has he learned about leadership? What was his biggest regret? Why did it seem like, in 2015, he finally started letting it fly, threw on his Beefsquatch costume and let everyone know “THIS IS ME NOW!” Gay marriage, health care, Charleston, the Iran deal… If you voted against him, 2015 was the year when his inner confidence bothered you more than ever. And if you voted for him, 2015 was definitely the year when you said, “<em>That</em> is the guy I voted for.” But what if Barack Obama has been that guy all along?</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>BILL SIMMONS: If you could go back to 2008 and tell yourself one thing, what would it be?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>BARACK OBAMA:</strong> “You’re going to be busy.” Coming in, we were going through an unprecedented economic upheaval, combined with an upheaval in the Middle East that we hadn’t seen in our lifetimes. There was going\nto be a huge amount of disruption. I would probably tell myself to communicate more effectively early on than I did. We ran a great campaign. It wasn’t as great as it seems in retrospect&#8212;there’s always rose-colored glasses but there’s no doubt that we captured the country’s imagination. And somehow in those first two years, I think a certain arrogance crept in, in the sense of thinking as long as we get the policy ready, we didn’t have to sell it.</p>\n<p>One thing I learned through some tough election cycles: You can’t separate good policy from the need to bring the American people along and make sure that they know why you’re doing what you’re doing. And that’s particularly\ntrue now in this new communications era. I think that we were ahead of the curve in 2008 in social media and the Internet and digital communications. When we came into office, instead of taking some of those lessons, we\nsuddenly adapted ourselves to the White House press room and structures that had been built back in the 1940s and ’50s. As a consequence of those missteps early, we got the policies right, and that’s why the economy now has grown for five and a half straight years, six years, and why unemployment rates have gone from 10 percent to 5.1 percent. But there was a lot of political pain along the way that might not have been necessary.</p>\n<p><strong>Was there a point in those first three years where you started to feel overwhelmed by the job? Where you\nwere just like, “My God, I just had no idea this was going to be this hard!”</strong><br>\nI had a pretty good handle. One thing I learned during the campaign was that I’ve got a good temperament. I don’t get too high and I don’t get too low. I’m able to stay focused even when there’s a lot of stuff going on around me.</p>\n<p><strong>So you’re like Gregg Popovich. Although he does get mad at sideline reporters.</strong><br>\n<em>[laughs]</em> He does. So do I. <em>[laughs]</em> Yeah. Or maybe [Aaron] Rodgers in the pocket, in the sense of you can’t be distracted by what’s around you, you’ve got to be looking downfield. And I think that’s a quality that I have&#8212;not getting flustered in what’s around me. So there was never a point, even early on&#8212;even in the first six months, where we weren’t sure whether we were going to dip into another Great Depression, we weren’t sure whether the steps we were taking on rescuing the auto industry or stabilizing the financial system were going to work&#8212;there weren’t moments where I thought, “Sheesh, feels like we’re in over our head.”</p>\n<p>But what I didn’t fully appreciate, and nobody can appreciate until they’re in the position, is how decentralized power is in this system. When you’re in the seat and you’re seeing the housing market collapse and you are seeing unemployment skyrocketing and you have a sense of what the right thing to do is, then you realize, “Okay, not only do I have to persuade my own party, not only do I have to prevent the other party from blocking what the right thing to do is, but now I can anticipate this lawsuit, this lobbying taking place, and this federal agency that technically is independent, so I can’t tell them what to do. I’ve got the Federal Reserve, and I’m hoping that they do the right thing&#8212;and by the way, since the economy now is global, I’ve got to make sure that the Europeans, the Asians, the Chinese, everybody is on board.” A lot of the work is not just identifying the right policy but now constantly building these ever shifting coalitions to be able to actually implement and execute and get it done.</p>\n<p><strong>You’re out to dinner with your wife and the phone rings. How many of the people in your life are you like, “Uh-oh, I’ve got to take this”?</strong><br>\nMalia and Sasha. <em>[laughs]</em> And maybe my mother-in-law. My national security adviser, Susan Rice, and Denis McDonough, my chief of staff. Those are the only people whose call I would take during a date night with Michelle. But the entire White House is full of people who have enormous responsibilities. You can’t do this by yourself. The principle of team building in the White House is really no different than the principle of team building anywhere, on a sports team or a well-run business. Do they put team ahead of themselves? Do you make sure all the pieces fit together? Because just having the best athletes, if they’re knocking heads and nobody’s doing rebounding and everybody wants the ball, it isn’t always going to work.</p>\n<p><strong>Is it fair to say that in 2015, you’ve been like the second-semester high school senior who got into Yale and now is like, “I’m going out tonight&#8212;I don’t care if I have a test tomorrow”? All of us were kind of waiting for that guy to show up after he got re-elected. What took two years to get there?</strong><br>\nThere’s no doubt that the longer I’m in this job, the more confident I am about the decisions I’m making and more knowledgeable about the responses I can expect. And as a consequence, you end up being looser. There’s not much I have not seen at this point, and I know what to expect, and I can anticipate more than I did before.</p>\n<p>I [also] have a case to make now that was harder to make earlier in my presidency. We had confidence, for example, that the economic decisions that we made to stabilize the financial system and pass Wall Street reform and raise\ntaxes on the wealthiest and pass health care&#8212;that would have a payoff. But because we had been in such a deep hole, we had to be careful about crowing success when people weren’t feeling it. And it wasn’t really until around 2014 where the attitude of the American people was, “The economy’s improving, I’m feeling better.”</p>\n<p><strong>So you feed off that.</strong><br>\nYou can make your case without caveats, which, I think, hampered my ability to communicate confidence and optimism to people. You didn’t want people to feel as if you were getting ahead of yourself. It’s a combination of me feeling looser because I’ve just been in this job a long time and have gone through some tough stretches. Not only do you not look like you have any fear, but you actually <em>don’t</em> have any fear. And I don’t at this point. The bets we made early on have paid off. Some of it does have to do with luck.</p>\n<p>Think about 2013, right after I’d been re-elected: Our goal was to lead with a big push on immigration reform. And then, before the second inauguration has even happened, [the school shooting at] Sandy Hook happens. Which remains, by the way, the worst few days of my presidency. I went up and visited with those families and&#8212;you know, Bill, you’ve still got small kids. These are 6-year-olds, right? And you have 20 of them who’ve been massacred. Right away, our focus had to shift to “Is there a way for us to capture this moment to see if we can get over this incredible hump to try to put in place some common-sense gun-safety rules?” And we knew it was a stretch, just because of the politics of Congress and the NRA. But we had to try.</p>\n<p>And throughout 2013 and 2014, you had a series of events like that&#8212;the Snowden disclosures, Ebola, Ferguson, ISIL, and unaccompanied children coming across the borders&#8212;all sort of stacked up in a row. None of them individually unsolvable, but given the 24/7 news cycle, they just sort of pile up on each other. Even though, in the midst of this, the economy is improving and we are making real progress on education and health care and energy and so forth, political momentum turns sharply against you. And so we’ve had more than our share of stormy seas, but we’ve navigated the ship well.</p>\n<p><strong>When Ferguson happened last year, I was waiting for Obama the Person to come in. But you had to be President Obama. How you handled Charleston this year and Selma&#8212;that was Obama the Person. So what happened with Ferguson? Do you wish you had handled that differently?</strong><br>\nYou know, the challenge of Ferguson and all issues related to police shootings, race, and the criminal-justice system is that in order to actually get something done, you have to build consensus. Expressing simple outrage without\nfollow-up is often counterproductive. In the case of Ferguson, I’m the attorney general’s boss. If I chime in with a strong opinion about what’s happened, not only do I stand to potentially damage subsequent law-enforcement cases, but immediately you get blowback and backlash that may make people less open to listening. What was different in Charleston was the clarity of what happened&#8212;that allowed, I think, everybody to be open to it.</p>\n<div class=\"embed callout-embed-component inset-right \" data-type=\"callout\"><div class=\"embed pullquote \" data-type=\"pullquote\"><span class=\"pullquote-content\"><blockquote>\n<p>“The fact that race has always been the fault line of our society and has always distorted our politics&#8212;that is not subject to argument.

Sometimes the circumstances won’t give you a clean statement. The fact that race has always been the fault line of our society and has always distorted our politics&#8212;that is not subject to argument. Part of what you’re looking for is a way not to just vent but to actually move the people. I practiced law for a while&#8212;a lot of times, hard cases can make bad law. If you have an issue that you want to put forward, you’re looking for the right plaintiff and the right court to appear before. I do think as you go on as president, you get a better feel for this, but you’re not always going to be perfect. When the Trayvon Martin case happened, I had an honest response as a father that I think resonated with a lot of people. When Ferguson happened, there was a gap between how quickly we could pull together a police task force, recommendations. And so in that lag, it feels as if I haven’t spoken to the moment as effectively. I suspect that if I were to do it over again, there might be something I could say that would’ve crystallized it more effectively. But Ferguson&#8212;the case itself was tougher because people didn’t know what was going on exactly. In some ways the [Eric] Garner case in New York was clearer because you had on videotape exactly what had happened, and some of the subsequent cases have been more obvious.</p>\n<p>One thing you learn as president is you’re not always going to perform flawlessly and you have to be able to put that out of your mind and then look at the next problem coming down the pipe. If I’m working out in the gym, sometimes I’ll go to NBA Classics and watch some of these old classic games&#8212;</p>\n<p><strong>The lack of HD really hurts&#8212;you can barely see anybody.</strong><br>\nIt’s true&#8212;and the graphics at the bottom are terrible. But a thing that you’re reminded of, watching those old Bulls games, is Jordan had some stinker games in the playoffs. But he would get that out of his mind, and then the next moment comes and he’s right there. He could have a terrible game for the first three quarters and then suddenly go crazy the fourth. Or he might miss a free throw, and then the next play is he’s stealing the ball and hitting the game-winning shot. Part of what I try to do&#8212;not at the level that Jordan did on the basketball court, but part of what you aspire to as president or any of these positions of leadership&#8212;is to try to figure out how to be in the moment, make the best decision you can, know that you’re going to get a bunch of them right, but a bunch of times you’re also not going to get it exactly the way you want it.</p>\n<p><strong>You win the election in 2008, and Twitter is just becoming a thing. Over the course of your presidency, that’s the biggest thing that’s changed. What’s the biggest challenge with all that stuff?</strong><br>\nSpeed. You are on 24/7&#8212;you have to respond immediately. The job of our office, to keep up and to respond quickly to anything that’s happening but not be consumed by it, is completely different. We’ve been building a digital team inside the White House.</p>\n<p><strong>When did that start?</strong><br>\nToo late. That’s an example of something that I would’ve started earlier. That was a lesson that coming out of the first term, I should’ve understood. That’s why we built this team. It’s so interesting watching my daughters. Both are complete ninjas on the phone, right? And they can do things that I don’t even understand&#8212;they’re doing it in two seconds. But I even see a difference between Malia, who’s 17, and Sasha, who’s 14. There’s almost a mini-generational gap in terms of Sasha being so connected seamlessly to this smartphone in a way that Malia, who was already a little bit older when it really started to take, is not.</p>\n<p><strong>The ability to multitask with 19 different friends at the same time…</strong><br>\nYeah. And just the degree to which her social life is so connected to that. So it’s not just having to change how we do business inside the White House to react to stories, but also, how do we tell a story about issues to constituencies that are completely splintered, who don’t watch television in the same way, who don’t watch the news in the same way? In some ways we’re just laying the foundation for what I assume will be the standard practice of future presidents.</p>\n<p><strong>Gun control: You’ve tried to legislate it as much as you possibly could and hit a wall basically in every direction. But the one thing Hillary Clinton has brought up is executive action.</strong><br>\nWell, keep in mind that after Sandy Hook, we put forward 23 executive actions. So we haven’t been asleep at the switch in terms of executive actions that we’ve tried. There are maybe a few more that had to be scrubbed by lawyers because, essentially, with every executive action, we can count on it being challenged by somebody in Congress or, in this case, the NRA. We want to make any executive action we take as defensible as possible legally. In the absence of a movement politically in which people say, “Enough is enough,” we’re going to continue to see, unfortunately, these tragedies take place. The main thing that I’ve been trying to communicate over the last several of these horrific episodes is that, contrary to popular belief, Americans are not more violent than people in other developed countries. But they have more deadly weapons to act out their rage, and that’s the only main variable that you see between the U.S. and these other countries.</p>\n<p><strong>It does feel like it’s going to become the dominant issue of year eight.</strong><br>\nI hope so. We have this weird habit in this culture of mourning and, you know, 48, 72 hours of wall-to-wall coverage, and then…suddenly we move on. And I will do everything I can to make sure that there’s a sustained attention paid to this thing.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s the most entertaining conspiracy theory you ever read about yourself?</strong><br>\nThat military exercises we were doing in Texas were designed to begin martial law so that I could usurp the Constitution and stay in power longer. Anybody who thinks I could get away with telling Michelle I’m going to be president any longer than eight years does not know my wife.</p>\n<p><strong>Have you ever said, “Give me the JFK-assassination files, I want to read them. Give me all the secret stuff”?</strong><br>\nI gotta tell you, it’s a little disappointing. People always ask me about Roswell and the aliens and UFOs, and it turns out the stuff going on that’s top secret isn’t nearly as exciting as you expect. In this day and age, it’s not as top secret as you’d think.</p>\n<p><strong>Would you ever want to be a Supreme Court justice?</strong><br>\n<em>[pauses]</em></p>\n<p><strong>You paused!</strong><br>\nNo&#8212;well, the reason I paused for a second was just to make sure that I let people know that I think good judges are really important, and Supreme Court justices, obviously, are hugely important. I don’t have the temperament to sit in relative solitude and just opine and write from the bench. I want to be in the action a little bit more.</p>\n<p><strong>Is it true you have a virtual driving range in the White House?</strong><br>\nTrue.</p>\n<p><strong>It’s in the bowels of the White House?</strong><br>\nYeah, I mean, this is not like some super-fancy thing. But I can hit these Wiffle balls.</p>\n<p><strong>So you go down there and hit, like as a stress reliever?</strong><br>\nYeah. Just whack ’em. Whack ’em around a little bit.</p>\n<p><strong>Has anyone come to the White House and picked up your older daughter for a date?</strong><br>\nNo, but I’ve seen some folks glancing at her in ways that made me not happy.</p>\n<p><strong>Tell the Secret Service, “Just take out that guy over there”?</strong><br>\n“Just keep an eye on him.”</p>\n<p><strong>Does it scare you that your wife could have a billion-dollar daytime talk show and you could be Stedman 2.0?</strong><br>\n<em>[laughs]</em> Uh…</p>\n<p><strong>Because that’s in play. She could do that if she wanted.</strong><br>\nAnd if that’s what she wants to do, I’m okay with her making a whole lot of money. There’s nothing wrong with that.</p>\n<p><strong>Would you ever want to be part of the ownership for an NBA team?</strong><br>\nAbsolutely.</p>\n<p><strong>Would it have to be the Bulls, or would it have to be somebody else?</strong><br>\nWell, you know, I know [Jerry] Reinsdorf pretty good&#8212;he’s not giving that thing up anytime soon. But I have fantasized about being able to put together a team and how much fun that would be. I think it’d be terrific.</p>\n<p><strong>How many times have you said to your kids, “Stop Googling me”?</strong><br>\nI don’t have to tell them that. They have no interest in me. I mean, they’re hopefully interested in me as a father.</p>\n<p><strong>Not as a public figure. What’s your guiltiest-pleasure TV show? Don’t say <em>Game of Thrones</em>, because that’s a good show.</strong><br>\nProbably the guiltiest pleasure&#8212;and this is kind of lame&#8212;is <em>Big Break</em>. You know, on the Golf Channel? Which is kind of a silly show. <em>[laughs]</em> But I find it really relaxing.</p>\n<div class=\"embed callout-embed-component aside \" data-type=\"callout\"><div class=\"embed pullquote \" data-type=\"pullquote\"><span class=\"pullquote-content\"><blockquote>\n<p>“Probably the guiltiest pleasure&#8212;and this is kind of lame&#8212;is <em>Big Break</em>.

Which is kind of a silly show. <em>[laughs]</em> But I find it really relaxing.”</p>\n</blockquote></span></div></div><p><strong>So you watch it on the treadmill or something?</strong><br>\nYeah, when I’m working out sometimes late at night. I never see all the episodes, but if they’ve got some chipping contest or something… <em>[laughs]</em> It’s pretty lame. I do love <em>Game of Thrones</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Which character do you identify with?</strong><br>\nMy favorite character is probably…the dwarf, what’s his name?</p>\n<p><strong>Oh, yeah. Peter Dinklage’s character.</strong><br>\nThe problem with <em>Game of Thrones,</em> though, is that I don’t remember the names of any of the characters.</p>\n<p><strong>I don’t, either.</strong><br>\nI remember the characters, so when I watch it, I know exactly what’s going on. But if you read a review of the show afterwards and they’re mentioning such and such, the only one I remember is Jon Snow, because I can pronounce Jon Snow.</p>\n<p><strong>Which <em>Game of Thrones</em> character is Donald Trump?</strong><br>\nUh…I don’t think…I don’t think any of them rise to that level.</p>\n<p><strong>If you were campaigning against Trump, would you even bother? Would it be like LaBradford Smith talking trash to Jordan or something?</strong><br>\nI would’ve enjoyed campaigning against Trump. That would’ve been fun.</p>\n<p><strong>Which leadership style suits your vision of where America should go forward? Biden or Hillary?</strong><br>\n<em>[laughs]</em> Come on, Bill.</p>\n<p><strong>I had to ask you one thing you can’t answer! Here’s one you have to answer: Who’s more untradable, Derrick Rose or Jay Cutler?</strong><br>\n<em>[pause]</em> Oh, I think Rose still has more upside. Remember, Rose is still awfully young.</p>\n<p><strong>So you haven’t given up on Rose?</strong><br>\nI’ve not given up on him. Sadly, I think it’s hard to imagine, after that many injuries, him getting back to his MVP-season performance. But he can still be a top-ten point guard.</p>\n<p><strong>Baseball, football, basketball, all the commissioner jobs open up next year. Which one would you want?</strong><br>\nWell, I’m best suited for basketball. But I cannot believe that the commissioner of football gets paid\n$44 million a year.</p>\n<p><strong>When you said, “I cannot believe…,” I didn’t know where you were going with that. Have you thought about calling <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/roger-goodell-season-from-hell\">Roger Goodell</a> and being like, “What are you <em>doing?</em> Can I help you?” [<em>Obama laughs</em>.] “Can I give you some advice? Want to have dinner?”</strong><br>\nThey’re making a profit, and I think that’s what the owners are most concerned with.</p>\n<p><strong>So you think the owners like having him there?</strong><br>\nYou’re not going to drag me into your fights, man. Come on&#8212;I’ve got enough fights of my own. <em>[laughs]</em> This is between you and Roger.</p>\n<p><strong>Number of cigarettes you’ve smoked in the White House since you got here?</strong><br>\nZero in the last five years. I made a promise that once health care passed, I would never have a cigarette again. And I have not.</p>\n<p><strong>What perk of being president are you going to miss the most?</strong><br>\nSo the clear answer would be Air Force One: an amazing plane with an amazing crew, they clear out airspace so you don’t have to wait. And you land anytime, you leave anytime. But it may be Marine One, because even post presidency, I may be able to round up a private plane sometime, but it’s tough not to have your helicopter waiting for you. <em>[laughs]</em></p>\n<p><strong>The last time I talked to you, you had one teenage daughter.</strong><br>\nNow I have two.</p>\n<p><strong>I’m two years away. Is it better, worse, or the same than what you expected when everybody told you, “Oh, just wait&#8212;just wait till they’re teenagers”?</strong><br>\nMy daughters are amazing girls. They’re smart, they’re funny. They take after their mom, and Michelle’s done a great job with them. You get these teenage moments&#8212;they love you, but what I think really affects you most is they just don’t have time for you. It’s not an active disdain for you. It’s just their calendars start filling up and they’ve got all\nthese friends who are much more interesting.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h2>The 14 Best Photos from the White House Flickr Account</h2>\n<div id=\"5646583ea3bd50211a99dc5a\" data-type=\"gallery\"></div><hr/>\n<p><strong>Yeah, you’re not the coolest person in their lives anymore.</strong><br>\nAnd you just have to let go, you have to acknowledge that if you say to them, “Hey, you want to go watch this movie?” or “Hey, you want to go take a swim at the pool?” “No, sorry, Daddy. I love you, though. See you tomorrow, ’cause I’m spending the night at somebody’s house.” The golden age is between, say, 6, 7, and 12, and they’re your buddies and they just want to hang out. And after that, they will love you, but they don’t have that much time for you. And my understanding is, based on friends of mine who have older kids, is that with a little bit of luck, as long as you’re not so completely annoying during these teenage years, they’ll come back to you around 23, 24, and actually want to hang out with you. But that stretch is painful. The compensation you get for the fact that they don’t have time for you is: Nothing beats watching your children become smarter and cooler than you are. And you suddenly will hear them say something or make a joke or have an insight and you go,\n“Wow. I didn’t think of that.”</p>\n<p><strong>Are they ready for you to be the ex-president?</strong><br>\nNot as much as Michelle, but certainly ready.</p>\n<p><strong>Oh, Michelle’s the leader of the power rankings?</strong><br>\nOh, absolutely. There are clear rankings. Michelle. Malia and Sasha, they’re constantly wrestling for second place. I rank ahead of the dogs.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Bill Simmons</strong> <em>is the founder of Grantland, the co-creator of ESPN’s</em> 30 for 30 <em>sports documentary series, and the best-selling author of</em> The Book of Basketball. <em>He is currently creating his own show for HBO, which will premiere next spring.</em></p>","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"channels":[{"id":"59b038ed0a8d2f0976474f19","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Culture","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"culture"}],"franchises":[{"id":"59b038eedd663e6940cf161b","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Men Of The Year","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"men-of-the-year"}],"famous-people":[{"id":"59b038ecdd663e6940cf158f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Bill Simmons","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"bill-simmons"},{"id":"59b038eb7246eb56980ac792","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Barack Obama","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"barack-obama"}],"topics":[{"id":"59b038ecf667492236d9173f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Politics","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"politics"}]},"channel":"News & Culture","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"56424a0aa3bd50211a99bd7c","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","email":"Bill_Simmons@condenast.com","name":"Bill Simmons","socialMedia":[]}]},"dek":"The leader of the free world sits down with the free agent of the year&#8212;HBO’s Bill Simmons&#8212;to discuss the Obama era and beyond.

bus tells you everything you need to know because the bus is a piece of shit. You would expect a Donald Trump campaign bus to be MOST LUXURIOUS, MOST DESIRED, NUMBER ONE BUS in the world, with a solid-gold chassis and marble toilets and a rooftop fuck cabana. This is not that bus. “It’s just a bus,” one Trump staffer told me, which is exactly right. It’s an old cross-country bus that still smells like an old cross-country bus, only it’s painted blue, with the name TRUMP in huge letters across both sides, plus the campaign hashtag <em>#Make America Great Again!</em> Trump says he has copyrighted it (“I’m using that a lot, and I think it’s a great statement”) even though you can’t actually put exclamation points or spaces in a hashtag.</p>\n<p>The bus is basically a rolling version of Trump’s Atlantic City: it’s built to look nice for a single day, then it falls into disrepair the moment you’ve stopped paying attention. From a distance, though, the bus looks like a monument. You see the name, and you take in everything that name connotes&#8212;wealth, ego, poor taste&#8212;and the bus has done its job. This is Trump’s bus, and it dominates the landscape the moment it arrives. People from all around take selfies near it. Why? Because TRUMP, that’s why.</p>\n<p>And the bus is working. Perhaps you’ve noticed&#8212;or perhaps you’re trying not to notice&#8212;but Donald Trump is leading all current Republican candidates in the national polls, and his lead is growing. And so it doesn’t really matter whether you see this as an alarming sign of the nation’s growing lunacy, or as a reckoning for a GOP that has been awash for years in hateful rhetoric, or as a byproduct of Trump’s masterful ability to hijack all political coverage by embracing his role as America’s Master Idiot. He’s doing it. At least for a brief moment, he’s winning. And he may extend his lead once the GOP debates begin Thursday night. Trump has managed to plaster his name all over this election as if it were one of his overpriced condos, and he has drawn the crowds as a result.</p>\n<p>And these are real voters out here who are responding to him: real voters who are lining up for his rallies in large numbers (not as large as Trump claims, but still!), real voters who hang on every word of his ridiculous pitch for how he will wheel and deal America back to the top.</p>\n<p>But who the fuck are these people? Are they blind? Are they crazy? Have they been brainwashed by all the giant signs? Or is it possible they see something in Trump that the rest of us don’t? What makes someone want to seriously consider voting for this man? I didn’t know what the answer was, but I wanted to see for myself. I needed to make it make sense. So I went to Iowa&#8212;Iowa: The State You Grew Up Swearing You’d Leave One Day!™&#8212;to meet them. And to see The Donald in the flesh.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Every election dispatch from Iowa is required to include a bit of scenery-setting, to show you just how folksy Iowa is: corn, state fairs, dragonflies, balloon museums, smiling fat babies, etc.</p>\n<p>This is not the Iowa I visited. The Donald Trump Make America Great Again Rally and Family Picnic was held in Oskaloosa, a small town 60 miles east of Des Moines. Oskaloosa is like a lot of small Midwestern towns right now: crumbling houses, shuttered businesses, half-empty strip malls.  You are surrounded by loss here. One of the few thriving businesses I saw in town, apart from a kickass bar called The Cellar Peanut Pub, was a video store. An actual video store. They didn’t even have to rent porn to stay solvent. They had customers, <em>and</em> they were hiring.</p>\n<p>Oskaloosa has been left behind in the Information Age. What has left here is never coming back, no matter what any politician or businessman promises. And people in Osky&#8212;the locals call it “Osky”&#8212;don’t look pleased about this. Contrary to friendly Midwestern stereotypes, they look PISSED. Every man I saw in town looked like your father-in-law the first time you met him at the door. Out on the empty roads, the only vehicles are big, angry pickup trucks with huge side mirrors sticking way out, like they wanna punch your car. People here are aggrieved. People here have had a lot of disappointment, and they are sick of it.</p>\n<p>Like Karen and Diane. Along with a bunch of friends and family, they showed up early this morning to the 696-seat George Daily Community Auditorium (which Oskaloosa’s middle school and high school share) so they could get as close to their billionaire savior as possible. To “see the color of his eyes,” Diane said. I greeted their group as they waited by the door, many of them sitting in nylon golf chairs, nervous about losing their spot in line.</p>\n<p>“I like that Trump won’t back down,” Karen told me. “He says what he means and he means what he’s saying. He ain’t going to say he’s sorry. Sometimes he likes to say things not politically correct, but they all better get used to that. The people who do speak politically correct have been losers.”</p>\n<p>“They constipated America!” Diane said, rocking a House of Blues t-shirt. “What we have had is politicians and lawyers who have constipated America. Let’s get a businessman in there and get things moving! We need our new MiraLAX!”</p>\n<p><em>Do you believe everything Trump says?</em></p>\n<p>“At this point, I’m inclined to say he’s not lying.”</p>\n<p><em>Do you think he exaggerates sometimes?</em></p>\n<p>“Oh yeah. Who doesn’t?”</p>\n<p>“He is for America,” Karen says. “He is for the elderly. He is for the quiet people.”</p>\n<p>Who are “<em>the quiet people</em>”?</p>\n<p>“The people like us, that a lot of times walk around with the attitude that, ‘Oh, it doesn’t matter what I think. I’m just from Osky.’ You know? <em>The quiet people</em>. The people who don’t think they have a voice.”</p>\n<p>Karen used to live in Arizona, where she had a job at a semiconductor plant, adding gold buttons to each chip in on anassembly line. But the plant was relocated to China, and so she lost her job and relocated here. As you could probably surmise, she likes Trump’s tough talk about foreigners stealing our jobs. I had arrived in Iowa just as Trump was doubling down on his comments that Mexico was sending “rapists” across our border; people here loved it, and seemed oddly emotional about the subject of immigration, even though Iowa is nowhere near the border. Apparently, it’s not just the immigrants from <em>Mexico</em> that concern Iowans for Trump. “We need to get the Muslims out of the country,” a man named Bob with a swirling white beard told me, “before they start killing our families!” Everyone around him nodded.</p>\n<p>The line to see Trump grew longer and stretched across the front of Oskaloosa middle school. A local Hy-Vee supermarket put up picnic tables and gave away bottled water, potato salad, pulled pork, and hot dogs thick as flashlights. Elderly people tooted around on Rascal scooters. An enterprising man hocked all-purpose GOP fanboy buttons with slogans like BENGHAZI MATTERS.</p>\n<p>I met an old couple wearing matching Trump t-shirts, which they told me they wore every day. “I haven’t had one bad comment on it,” said the wife. I met a man named Wayne who voted for Obama twice but was now firmly in Trump’s corner. I met ANOTHER man named Wayne who walked me carefully through his five-point rationale for why Trump was the best candidate. (Voters often show up at these rallies with little stump speeches of their own.) I met a woman named Jill who showed up with several hand-drawn signs. (My favorite was “Beltway Talks; Trump Works.”) Jill was <em>fired the fuck up</em> for some Trump in her life. I don’t know how it’s possible to be so fired up with the election so far away, but Jill was <em>blazing</em>. She wanted to make sure the whole world knew that Trump and his voters were for real.</p>\n<p>“I was terribly insulted when [John McCain] called us crazies,” Jill told me.</p>\n<p><em>What is it that you like so much about Trump?</em></p>\n<p>“He’s a capitalist,” Jill explained. “That inspires me.”</p>\n<p>I also ran into a very rare minority in the crowd&#8212;a Pakistani woman who emigrated here from Pakistan 40 years ago and didn’t like the idea of anyone skirting the naturalization process.</p>\n<p>“I came in the right way,” she told me. “When you try to do things the right way, it doesn’t work. And all these illegals sneaking in, and being able to stay&#8212;how do they get to do that?”</p>\n<p><em>And you think Trump will make things fairer</em>.</p>\n<p>“Well, as long as he does a better job than what’s being done. You know?”</p>\n<p>A nervous drug counselor named Tracy was also in line to see Trump. Unlike some of the others, she had some concerns about him. Well, one: “He’s an atheist,” she said.</p>\n<p>A man nearby overheard us talking and told us he shared her worry. “We have to elect godly men.”</p>\n<p>But Jill&#8212;the sign lady&#8212;cut into the conversation and came to the rescue: “He’s not an atheist. I wanted to correct that. He explained the church he’s gone to his whole life. He didn’t articulate it as well as he should have. But you know what? That articulation&#8212;I’m not concerned with that.”</p>\n<p>That seemed to cool Tracy’s hangups about Trump being a godless heathen.</p>\n<p>And I spotted a woman pushing around a stroller with a photograph of a live abortion taped to it, along with a big sign that read “DEAR PLANNED PARENTHOOD, I AM NOT FOR SALE.” For some reason, the woman ditched the stroller in the middle of the path leading to the auditorium, and a squat veteran named Randy went to alert the police. “That’s a good way to get a bomb brought in,” he said. While we all stared at the stroller, looking for any suspicious bulges (it turned out to be clean), Randy explained to me why he had a big ol’ Trump-on.</p>\n<p>“I like what he has to say. He won’t take no shit from nobody.”</p>\n<p><em>What’s your favorite thing he’s said?</em></p>\n<p>“You’re fired!”</p>\n<p><em>Who would you like him to fire, besides Obama?</em></p>\n<p>“Let’s see: John Kerry, our last governor, the attorney general, every Muslim that they put in…”</p>\n<p>Randy seemed untroubled by Trump’s lack of polish, or knowledge, or basic human grace. Far from it&#8212;these were virtues. “You don’t have to be a brain to run a business,” Randy said. “Just an ass. Sometimes you can be nice and polite, but there’s sometimes you’ve just got to be a horse’s ass with somebody to get them to do what they’re supposed to be doing.”</p>\n<p>So far, I’d heard Trump compared&#8212;favorably&#8212;to a horse’s ass and to a laxative, and I began to imagine a Trump campaign poster that was just a big horse’s butthole spewing hot diarrhea.</p>\n<p><em>So you believe Trump has the fearlessness to run this country?</em></p>\n<p>“I know he does,” said Randy. “Have you ever watched <em>The Apprentice?</em>”</p>\n<p>I talked to more voters and a pattern emerged in the answers. Trump was “honest,” “not PC,” “authentic,” “shooting from the hip,” and “called a spade a spade.” And of course, he wasn’t from Washington. He was gonna get in there and shake things up.</p>\n<p>We’ve heard all of this before, from many, many other candidates. Every presidential election has at least one magical, imaginary OUTSIDER&#8212;that teenage wet dream of a president who rides into Washington, tells those bureaucrats what shitheads they are, and bulldozes Congress into doing cool shit simply with the power of his huge cock. I have fallen for this kind of candidate. YOU have fallen for this kind of candidate. Everybody wants this mythical Bulworth to exist, but at this level of politics, there are no outsiders, and the game changes its rules for no one.</p>\n<p>And yet, people buy in. Maybe this time, they think, the guy who says he’s different really is different.</p>\n<p>And Trump, to his credit, is definitely different.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Noon was approaching and the doors to the auditorium opened. Trump supporters poured into seats in front of the stage and onto a set of risers behind the podium. The hated media&#8212;that would include me&#8212;sat toward the back.</p>\n<p>After a couple of introductory speeches from a local politician and a member of Seal Team Seven (not Six, but Seven&#8212;they’re one better!), we were greeted by former <em>Apprentice</em> runner-up Tana Goertz, who also happens to be Trump 2016’s Iowa co-chair and a “well-known Bedazzler spokeswoman.”</p>\n<p>“We all know how much Donald Trump is worth!” Goertz cried out, inaccurately. “How much?” The response from the crowd was messy and overlapping&#8212;many wild guesses called out at once.</p>\n<p>“I’ve met a lot of smart people,” Goertz continued, undaunted, “but I have never met a man that thinks about working when other people are talking about working.”</p>\n<p><em>Wait, what?</em></p>\n<p>“At the heart of it all, he’s a builder. Who better than Donald Trump to rebuild this country?”</p>\n<p>Okay, that’s a metaphor I can get behind.</p>\n<p>“You have never ever in your life experienced what you’re about to experience today. I’m just going to say: Sit back, put on your seatbelt. It’s going to be a fun ride. You will enjoy the experience and the ride, which is Donald Trump.”</p>\n<p>Finally&#8212;after a quick Pledge of Allegiance&#8212;the man himself emerged through a side door, carried aloft by the strains of Joe Esposito’s “You’re The Best.”</p>\n<p>I saw the hair first. It arrived in two parts: first the Turtle Wax-ed strands that run along both sides of his scalp, then the champagne glitter yarn kit perched top. I’d never seen Trump before, and the hair was all that I’d hoped for, and more. And after announcing his intention to molest all of Iowa’s chief export (“I want to grab that corn like you’ve never seen&#8212;so beautiful”) the ride started up.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>I’m gonna say a few nice things about Donald Trump now. If that terrifies you, then by all means, skim through this section and carry on with your existence.</p>\n<p>But I must tell you that, in person, Donald Trump is a very entertaining public speaker. And is this really such a surprise? Ever since* The Art of the Deal*, Trump has spent decades giving speeches all over the country, acting as our Get-Rich-Quick godfather. When he gets in front of a microphone, he requires no notes. No teleprompter. He is confident. He is casual. He is charming. Everyone is a “great guy” or an “amazing negotiator.”</p>\n<p>He can even be funny. When I texted a friend from the event that Trump was hilarious in person, he texted back, “NO. No no no.” Sorry, it’s true. It’s still not clear whether he’s in on the joke&#8212;there’s always been a bit of mystery to how aware Donald Trump is that Donald Trump is full of shit. But when you see him in person, and you hear him claim that the term “Supreme Leader” would be more fitting for him than for the head of Iran, there is the tiniest hint that he knows what a ludicrous thing this is to say. Even his exaggerations are hilarious. He said this was the biggest crowd in state history, even though we were in a public-school auditorium. He said he was worth more than $10 billion, a figure that is impossible for him to prove but also impossible for us to disprove. He said he made $213 million from <em>The Apprentice</em>, a figure which NBC steadfastly refutes.</p>\n<p>At one point, Trump boasted about how much veterans adore him. To prove it, he trotted out a gorgeous brunette who was carrying a perfect stack of white paper topped with a bow. I swear it looked like an unwrapped package of blank Hammermill printer paper. “In one day,” Trump blared, “many hundreds of letters from Vietnam vets, thanking me. This is from veterans. Each page, a different letter. It’s amazing.”</p>\n<p>Everyone ate it up. They laughed and cheered and hollered out in approval all through his speech.  It was more like a late-night monologue, and true to his reputation, Trump is not careful with his words. You can see why people think he’s more “honest” than one of the other randos in the GOP field&#8212;he’s gifted at not sounding like a politician even as he deploys standard tricks from the “I’m not a politician” handbook. He is definitely more fun to watch than Bobby Jindal. I wish there were more Trump-like candidates out there who are not Donald Trump, if that makes any sense.</p>\n<p>He also made a good point or two in between all the noise. At one point he bellowed: “I read Jeb Bush raised over a hundred million dollars. Now if you think that those people giving him all those money aren’t getting a lot, you’re wrong. All of these people are controlled by the people who gave them their money.” He’s right! It’s true! Holy shit, Donald Trump said a true thing. I heard it with my own two ears.</p>\n<p>If Donald Trump has one undeniable virtue as a politician, it’s that he does not try to fake being one of us. He’s not going to the fucking Bowl-o-Rama on a Saturday night in a plaid shirt to prove he’s a man of the people. The whole thrust of The Donald’s campaign is that he is special. He is extraordinary. In Osky, he compared his business acumen to Jack Nicklaus’ golfing ability and Babe Ruth’s hitting ability. (“It’s called talent. <em>Talent</em>.”) He is a WINNER, and he is here to help this nation of sad losers learn how to win again.</p>\n<p>“We don’t win anymore in this country,” he told the crowd. “When was the last time we won? When did we beat China in a deal? We don’t win.”</p>\n<p>Well, Trump is here to fix all that losing. And here is where my brief jag of mildly effusive praise for Donald Trump must come to an end, because the grim undercurrent of his rise is SHAME.  After all, if you believe we must make America great again, then you must also believe that America, at the present moment, sucks. And pretty much everyone at the Trump picnic believed that America sucks. When I asked a group of Trump supporters outside if they were proud of America, they all laughed with derision. <em>Of course</em> they weren’t proud of America. Of course this nation is a shithole. One voter named Corey told me he hoped Trump would help America “get back to the way it was,” a refrain I heard from a lot of people, as if the country was a rock band that had changed its sound. Backing Trump means acknowledging that you live in a world of failure, and that your last best hope is the Music Man moseying into town.</p>\n<p>Now, here is how Donald Trump says he will Make America Great Again™. In Trump’s worldview, politics is little more than series of deals to be made. Every complex global problem, or intractable adversary, can be tamed with sufficiently hard-ass steakhouse dealmaking. He explained it all in Osky:</p>\n<p>“I know the greatest negotiators in the world,” he said. “Now some of these people are horrible human beings. You wouldn’t have them to dinner. They’re vicious. They’re crude. They’re unhappy. They treat everybody badly. Who cares? I want them negotiating against China. Think of Carl Icahn, a friend of mine. He’d be great. I’d say, ‘Carl, take China’.”</p>\n<p>Now, people applauded this, which alarmed me because (A) Who has friends like this? And (B) Sending a vicious, crude, unhappy person who treats everyone badly to go yell FUCK YOU at the Chinese strikes me as unwise.</p>\n<p>But Trump is so certain, so supremely confident, that everyone at his rallies go for the idea anyway. It comes off as an act of counterintuitive genius. What’s not to like about the idea that you can fix everything by just marching into Washington and yelling at all the dummies to stop being dummies? I wish politics were that simple. I really do. Politics <em>should</em> be that simple. Trump’s gift is that he really can make it sound that easy, even when it’s all a huge lie. His swagger is <em>your</em> swagger. He can reduce entire countries down to a cardboard persona. He’ll get tough with Mexico. He’ll have Carl take China. The way Trump explains it, you’d think China had only one person in it.</p>\n<p>Trump is so certain of his horseshit that, on that stage in Osky, he laid out a remarkable future scenario of him in the Oval Office that was essentially one enormous lie that hasn’t had the chance to become a lie yet. Here now is what President Trump would do if Ford tried to build a manufacturing plant down in Mexico:</p>\n<p>“It’s so easy. <em>It’s too easy</em>. I do it with a phone call. I call the head of Ford, and I say, ‘Every single car and truck that comes into the US, we’re going to tax you 35 percent’.”</p>\n<p>Massive applause! Trump wasn’t done.</p>\n<p>“So this isn’t 99.9 percent&#8212;this is <em>one hundred percent</em> what’s going to happen: He’ll call me back, probably that afternoon, but he may play it tough and call me back the next day. The next day I’ll get a call from Ben Ford”&#8212;NOTE: there is no Ben Ford; I assume he meant Bill&#8212;“and he’ll say, ‘Mr. President, we decided not to build that plant. We’ll build it in the United States.’”</p>\n<p>And everyone in the joint bought it! They damn near broke their hands clapping for this idea! I almost bought it myself! At least, I did for half a second before I thought, <em>Wait, don’t you need Congress to approve shit like that? And wouldn’t forcing the plant to be built here increase the cost of Fords? And then wouldn’t people stop buying Fords? And then wouldn’t Ford go belly up, costing us even MORE jobs than if we had just left the goddamn plant in Mexico? And what about the many, many Fords that are already produced in Mexico?</em></p>\n<p>But a Trump rally isn’t about thinking more than half a second ahead. There is a first BOLD step, and then you are left to assume that everything else will fall neatly into place. In Trump’s white-trash, Louis XIV universe, all you see is the pretty gold paint before it starts chipping off the walls.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Money, ironically, is what will likely wind up being Trump’s political downfall. Once the primary field has been winnowed down to a few schlubs, the GOP establishment will dump its funds into a single candidate with the goal of overtaking Trump, whom they all despise. (Yet one more reason why voters here love him, by the way.) And as rich Trump may claim to be, there are limits to how much of his personal fortune he’ll spend on this effort.</p>\n<p>Once the GOP muscles him out, Trump may very well run a third-party campaign that divides conservative voters and all but hands the 2016 election to a waiting Hillary Clinton. In Osky, this was every thinking Trump voter’s nightmare scenario. “As long as he doesn’t split parties, I’m there,” one attendee told me. “If he does that, it’s too important of an election.” But it could happen. And if it does, Trump may go from the darling of far-right conservatives voters to their most-hated nemesis.</p>\n<p>At the end of Trump’s speech, “We’re Not Gonna Take It” by Twisted Sister boomed through the speakers and played him off the stage.  The crowd grave him a standing O on his way out. The ride was over. The reviews outside were glowing: “Awesome.” “I loved his demeanor.” “Solutions.” “It’s nice to hear somebody talk who’s not a politician.” They were all sold. They were all going to home to preach the gospel of their King Midas.</p>\n<p>As I watched everyone file out, I thought of a moment during Tana Goertz’s opening-act speech earlier in the day, when she pleaded with everyone to eat more of the food outside. “Mr. Trump can’t take all this food home on the plane,” she told us. “There’s not enough room.” And so as all of Trump’s energized constituents filed out of the joint, I pictured him getting onto his plane, cigar in the corner of his mouth, jetting back to the Land of Winners. And I pictured everyone else stuck back here in Osky, with nothing but the scraps he left behind for all the quiet people.</p>","categories":{"channels":[{"id":"59b038ed0a8d2f0976474f19","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Culture","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"culture"}],"famous-people":[{"id":"59b038eddd663e6940cf1605","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"}],"topics":[{"id":"59b038ed7246eb56980ac830","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Election","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"election"},{"id":"59b038ecf667492236d9173f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Politics","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"politics"}]},"channel":"News & Culture","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"558285b9e52bc4b477a968a5","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","name":"Drew Magary","socialMedia":[{"network":"Twitter","handle":"@drewmagary"}]}]},"dek":"America is constipated, says one Trump supporter&#8212;and The Donald?

bus tells you everything you need to know because the bus is a piece of shit. You would expect a Donald Trump campaign bus to be MOST LUXURIOUS, MOST DESIRED, NUMBER ONE BUS in the world, with a solid-gold chassis and marble toilets and a rooftop fuck cabana. This is not that bus. “It’s just a bus,” one Trump staffer told me, which is exactly right. It’s an old cross-country bus that still smells like an old cross-country bus, only it’s painted blue, with the name TRUMP in huge letters across both sides, plus the campaign hashtag *#Make America Great Again!* Trump says he has copyrighted it (“I’m using that a lot, and I think it’s a great statement”) even though you can’t actually put exclamation points or spaces in a hashtag. \n\nThe bus is basically a rolling version of Trump’s Atlantic City: it’s built to look nice for a single day, then it falls into disrepair the moment you’ve stopped paying attention. From a distance, though, the bus looks like a monument. You see the name, and you take in everything that name connotes—wealth, ego, poor taste—and the bus has done its job. This is Trump’s bus, and it dominates the landscape the moment it arrives. People from all around take selfies near it. Why? Because TRUMP, that’s why.\n\n+++feature-small\n\n[#article: /articles/56b8fb71b89407780bd7bd8d]||||||\n\n+++\n\nAnd the bus is working. Perhaps you’ve noticed—or perhaps you’re trying not to notice—but Donald Trump is leading all current Republican candidates in the national polls, and his lead is growing. And so it doesn’t really matter whether you see this as an alarming sign of the nation’s growing lunacy, or as a reckoning for a GOP that has been awash for years in hateful rhetoric, or as a byproduct of Trump’s masterful ability to hijack all political coverage by embracing his role as America’s Master Idiot. He’s doing it. At least for a brief moment, he’s winning. And he may extend his lead once the GOP debates begin Thursday night. Trump has managed to plaster his name all over this election as if it were one of his overpriced condos, and he has drawn the crowds as a result. \n\nAnd these are real voters out here who are responding to him: real voters who are lining up for his rallies in large numbers (not as large as Trump claims, but still!), real voters who hang on every word of his ridiculous pitch for how he will wheel and deal America back to the top.\n\nBut who the fuck are these people? Are they blind? Are they crazy? Have they been brainwashed by all the giant signs? Or is it possible they see something in Trump that the rest of us don’t? What makes someone want to seriously consider voting for this man? I didn’t know what the answer was, but I wanted to see for myself. I needed to make it make sense. So I went to Iowa—Iowa: The State You Grew Up Swearing You’d Leave One Day!™—to meet them. And to see The Donald in the flesh. \n\n----------\n\nEvery election dispatch from Iowa is required to include a bit of scenery-setting, to show you just how folksy Iowa is: corn, state fairs, dragonflies, balloon museums, smiling fat babies, etc. \n\nThis is not the Iowa I visited. The Donald Trump Make America Great Again Rally and Family Picnic was held in Oskaloosa, a small town 60 miles east of Des Moines. Oskaloosa is like a lot of small Midwestern towns right now: crumbling houses, shuttered businesses, half-empty strip malls.  You are surrounded by loss here. One of the few thriving businesses I saw in town, apart from a kickass bar called The Cellar Peanut Pub, was a video store. An actual video store. They didn’t even have to rent porn to stay solvent. They had customers, *and* they were hiring.\n\nOskaloosa has been left behind in the Information Age. What has left here is never coming back, no matter what any politician or businessman promises. And people in Osky—the locals call it “Osky”—don’t look pleased about this. Contrary to friendly Midwestern stereotypes, they look PISSED. Every man I saw in town looked like your father-in-law the first time you met him at the door. Out on the empty roads, the only vehicles are big, angry pickup trucks with huge side mirrors sticking way out, like they wanna punch your car. People here are aggrieved. People here have had a lot of disappointment, and they are sick of it.\n\nLike Karen and Diane. Along with a bunch of friends and family, they showed up early this morning to the 696-seat George Daily Community Auditorium (which Oskaloosa’s middle school and high school share) so they could get as close to their billionaire savior as possible. To “see the color of his eyes,” Diane said. I greeted their group as they waited by the door, many of them sitting in nylon golf chairs, nervous about losing their spot in line.\n\n“I like that Trump won’t back down,” Karen told me. “He says what he means and he means what he’s saying. He ain’t going to say he’s sorry. Sometimes he likes to say things not politically correct, but they all better get used to that. The people who do speak politically correct have been losers.” \n\n“They constipated America!” Diane said, rocking a House of Blues t-shirt. “What we have had is politicians and lawyers who have constipated America. Let’s get a businessman in there and get things moving! We need our new MiraLAX!”\n\n*Do you believe everything Trump says?* \n\n“At this point, I’m inclined to say he’s not lying.” \n\n*Do you think he exaggerates sometimes?*\n\n“Oh yeah. Who doesn’t?”\n\n“He is for America,” Karen says. “He is for the elderly. He is for the quiet people.”\n\nWho are “*the quiet people*”?\n\n“The people like us, that a lot of times walk around with the attitude that, ‘Oh, it doesn’t matter what I think. I’m just from Osky.’ You know? *The quiet people*. The people who don’t think they have a voice.”\n\nKaren used to live in Arizona, where she had a job at a semiconductor plant, adding gold buttons to each chip in on anassembly line. But the plant was relocated to China, and so she lost her job and relocated here. As you could probably surmise, she likes Trump’s tough talk about foreigners stealing our jobs. I had arrived in Iowa just as Trump was doubling down on his comments that Mexico was sending “rapists” across our border; people here loved it, and seemed oddly emotional about the subject of immigration, even though Iowa is nowhere near the border. Apparently, it’s not just the immigrants from *Mexico* that concern Iowans for Trump. “We need to get the Muslims out of the country,” a man named Bob with a swirling white beard told me, “before they start killing our families!” Everyone around him nodded.\n\nThe line to see Trump grew longer and stretched across the front of Oskaloosa middle school. A local Hy-Vee supermarket put up picnic tables and gave away bottled water, potato salad, pulled pork, and hot dogs thick as flashlights. Elderly people tooted around on Rascal scooters. An enterprising man hocked all-purpose GOP fanboy buttons with slogans like BENGHAZI MATTERS. \n\nI met an old couple wearing matching Trump t-shirts, which they told me they wore every day. “I haven’t had one bad comment on it,” said the wife. I met a man named Wayne who voted for Obama twice but was now firmly in Trump’s corner. I met ANOTHER man named Wayne who walked me carefully through his five-point rationale for why Trump was the best candidate. (Voters often show up at these rallies with little stump speeches of their own.) I met a woman named Jill who showed up with several hand-drawn signs. (My favorite was “Beltway Talks; Trump Works.”) Jill was *fired the fuck up* for some Trump in her life. I don’t know how it’s possible to be so fired up with the election so far away, but Jill was *blazing*. She wanted to make sure the whole world knew that Trump and his voters were for real.\n\n“I was terribly insulted when [John McCain] called us crazies,” Jill told me.\n\n*What is it that you like so much about Trump?*\n\n“He’s a capitalist,” Jill explained. “That inspires me.”\n\nI also ran into a very rare minority in the crowd—a Pakistani woman who emigrated here from Pakistan 40 years ago and didn’t like the idea of anyone skirting the naturalization process. \n\n“I came in the right way,” she told me. “When you try to do things the right way, it doesn’t work. And all these illegals sneaking in, and being able to stay—how do they get to do that?”\n\n*And you think Trump will make things fairer*.\n\n“Well, as long as he does a better job than what’s being done. You know?”\n\nA nervous drug counselor named Tracy was also in line to see Trump. Unlike some of the others, she had some concerns about him. Well, one: “He’s an atheist,” she said.\n\nA man nearby overheard us talking and told us he shared her worry. “We have to elect godly men.”\n\nBut Jill—the sign lady—cut into the conversation and came to the rescue: “He’s not an atheist. I wanted to correct that. He explained the church he’s gone to his whole life. He didn’t articulate it as well as he should have. But you know what? That articulation—I’m not concerned with that.”\n\nThat seemed to cool Tracy’s hangups about Trump being a godless heathen.\n\nAnd I spotted a woman pushing around a stroller with a photograph of a live abortion taped to it, along with a big sign that read “DEAR PLANNED PARENTHOOD, I AM NOT FOR SALE.” For some reason, the woman ditched the stroller in the middle of the path leading to the auditorium, and a squat veteran named Randy went to alert the police. “That’s a good way to get a bomb brought in,” he said. While we all stared at the stroller, looking for any suspicious bulges (it turned out to be clean), Randy explained to me why he had a big ol’ Trump-on.\n\n“I like what he has to say. He won’t take no shit from nobody.”\n\n*What’s your favorite thing he’s said?* \n\n“You’re fired!”\n\n*Who would you like him to fire, besides Obama?*\n\n“Let’s see: John Kerry, our last governor, the attorney general, every Muslim that they put in…”\n\nRandy seemed untroubled by Trump’s lack of polish, or knowledge, or basic human grace. Far from it—these were virtues. “You don’t have to be a brain to run a business,” Randy said. “Just an ass. Sometimes you can be nice and polite, but there’s sometimes you’ve just got to be a horse’s ass with somebody to get them to do what they’re supposed to be doing.”\n\nSo far, I’d heard Trump compared—favorably—to a horse’s ass and to a laxative, and I began to imagine a Trump campaign poster that was just a big horse’s butthole spewing hot diarrhea.\n\n*So you believe Trump has the fearlessness to run this country?*\n\n“I know he does,” said Randy. “Have you ever watched *The Apprentice?*”\n\nI talked to more voters and a pattern emerged in the answers. Trump was “honest,” “not PC,” “authentic,” “shooting from the hip,” and “called a spade a spade.” And of course, he wasn’t from Washington. He was gonna get in there and shake things up. \n\nWe’ve heard all of this before, from many, many other candidates. Every presidential election has at least one magical, imaginary OUTSIDER—that teenage wet dream of a president who rides into Washington, tells those bureaucrats what shitheads they are, and bulldozes Congress into doing cool shit simply with the power of his huge cock. I have fallen for this kind of candidate. YOU have fallen for this kind of candidate. Everybody wants this mythical Bulworth to exist, but at this level of politics, there are no outsiders, and the game changes its rules for no one.\n\nAnd yet, people buy in. Maybe this time, they think, the guy who says he’s different really is different. \n\nAnd Trump, to his credit, is definitely different.\n\n----------\n\nNoon was approaching and the doors to the auditorium opened. Trump supporters poured into seats in front of the stage and onto a set of risers behind the podium. The hated media—that would include me—sat toward the back. \n\nAfter a couple of introductory speeches from a local politician and a member of Seal Team Seven (not Six, but Seven—they’re one better!), we were greeted by former *Apprentice* runner-up Tana Goertz, who also happens to be Trump 2016’s Iowa co-chair and a “well-known Bedazzler spokeswoman.”\n\n“We all know how much Donald Trump is worth!” Goertz cried out, inaccurately. “How much?” The response from the crowd was messy and overlapping—many wild guesses called out at once.\n\n“I’ve met a lot of smart people,” Goertz continued, undaunted, “but I have never met a man that thinks about working when other people are talking about working.”\n\n*Wait, what?*\n\n“At the heart of it all, he’s a builder. Who better than Donald Trump to rebuild this country?”\n\nOkay, that’s a metaphor I can get behind. \n\n“You have never ever in your life experienced what you’re about to experience today. I’m just going to say: Sit back, put on your seatbelt. It’s going to be a fun ride. You will enjoy the experience and the ride, which is Donald Trump.”\n\nFinally—after a quick Pledge of Allegiance—the man himself emerged through a side door, carried aloft by the strains of Joe Esposito’s “You’re The Best.” \n\nI saw the hair first. It arrived in two parts: first the Turtle Wax-ed strands that run along both sides of his scalp, then the champagne glitter yarn kit perched top. I’d never seen Trump before, and the hair was all that I’d hoped for, and more. And after announcing his intention to molest all of Iowa’s chief export (“I want to grab that corn like you’ve never seen—so beautiful”) the ride started up.\n\n\n----------\n\n\nI’m gonna say a few nice things about Donald Trump now. If that terrifies you, then by all means, skim through this section and carry on with your existence.\n\nBut I must tell you that, in person, Donald Trump is a very entertaining public speaker. And is this really such a surprise? Ever since* The Art of the Deal*, Trump has spent decades giving speeches all over the country, acting as our Get-Rich-Quick godfather. When he gets in front of a microphone, he requires no notes. No teleprompter. He is confident. He is casual. He is charming. Everyone is a “great guy” or an “amazing negotiator.”\t \n\nHe can even be funny. When I texted a friend from the event that Trump was hilarious in person, he texted back, “NO. No no no.” Sorry, it’s true. It’s still not clear whether he’s in on the joke—there’s always been a bit of mystery to how aware Donald Trump is that Donald Trump is full of shit. But when you see him in person, and you hear him claim that the term “Supreme Leader” would be more fitting for him than for the head of Iran, there is the tiniest hint that he knows what a ludicrous thing this is to say. Even his exaggerations are hilarious. He said this was the biggest crowd in state history, even though we were in a public-school auditorium. He said he was worth more than $10 billion, a figure that is impossible for him to prove but also impossible for us to disprove. He said he made $213 million from *The Apprentice*, a figure which NBC steadfastly refutes.\n\nAt one point, Trump boasted about how much veterans adore him. To prove it, he trotted out a gorgeous brunette who was carrying a perfect stack of white paper topped with a bow. I swear it looked like an unwrapped package of blank Hammermill printer paper. “In one day,” Trump blared, “many hundreds of letters from Vietnam vets, thanking me. This is from veterans. Each page, a different letter. It’s amazing.” \n\nEveryone ate it up. They laughed and cheered and hollered out in approval all through his speech.  It was more like a late-night monologue, and true to his reputation, Trump is not careful with his words. You can see why people think he’s more “honest” than one of the other randos in the GOP field—he’s gifted at not sounding like a politician even as he deploys standard tricks from the “I’m not a politician” handbook. He is definitely more fun to watch than Bobby Jindal. I wish there were more Trump-like candidates out there who are not Donald Trump, if that makes any sense.\n\nHe also made a good point or two in between all the noise. At one point he bellowed: “I read Jeb Bush raised over a hundred million dollars. Now if you think that those people giving him all those money aren’t getting a lot, you’re wrong. All of these people are controlled by the people who gave them their money.” He’s right! It’s true! Holy shit, Donald Trump said a true thing. I heard it with my own two ears. \n\nIf Donald Trump has one undeniable virtue as a politician, it’s that he does not try to fake being one of us. He’s not going to the fucking Bowl-o-Rama on a Saturday night in a plaid shirt to prove he’s a man of the people. The whole thrust of The Donald’s campaign is that he is special. He is extraordinary. In Osky, he compared his business acumen to Jack Nicklaus’ golfing ability and Babe Ruth’s hitting ability. (“It’s called talent. *Talent*.”) He is a WINNER, and he is here to help this nation of sad losers learn how to win again. \n\n“We don’t win anymore in this country,” he told the crowd. “When was the last time we won? When did we beat China in a deal? We don’t win.”\n\nWell, Trump is here to fix all that losing. And here is where my brief jag of mildly effusive praise for Donald Trump must come to an end, because the grim undercurrent of his rise is SHAME.  After all, if you believe we must make America great again, then you must also believe that America, at the present moment, sucks. And pretty much everyone at the Trump picnic believed that America sucks. When I asked a group of Trump supporters outside if they were proud of America, they all laughed with derision. *Of course* they weren’t proud of America. Of course this nation is a shithole. One voter named Corey told me he hoped Trump would help America “get back to the way it was,” a refrain I heard from a lot of people, as if the country was a rock band that had changed its sound. Backing Trump means acknowledging that you live in a world of failure, and that your last best hope is the Music Man moseying into town.\n\nNow, here is how Donald Trump says he will Make America Great Again™. In Trump’s worldview, politics is little more than series of deals to be made. Every complex global problem, or intractable adversary, can be tamed with sufficiently hard-ass steakhouse dealmaking. He explained it all in Osky:\n\n“I know the greatest negotiators in the world,” he said. “Now some of these people are horrible human beings. You wouldn’t have them to dinner. They’re vicious. They’re crude. They’re unhappy. They treat everybody badly. Who cares? I want them negotiating against China. Think of Carl Icahn, a friend of mine. He’d be great. I’d say, ‘Carl, take China’.”\n\nNow, people applauded this, which alarmed me because (A) Who has friends like this? And (B) Sending a vicious, crude, unhappy person who treats everyone badly to go yell FUCK YOU at the Chinese strikes me as unwise. \n\nBut Trump is so certain, so supremely confident, that everyone at his rallies go for the idea anyway. It comes off as an act of counterintuitive genius. What’s not to like about the idea that you can fix everything by just marching into Washington and yelling at all the dummies to stop being dummies? I wish politics were that simple. I really do. Politics *should* be that simple. Trump’s gift is that he really can make it sound that easy, even when it’s all a huge lie. His swagger is *your* swagger. He can reduce entire countries down to a cardboard persona. He’ll get tough with Mexico. He’ll have Carl take China. The way Trump explains it, you’d think China had only one person in it.\n\nTrump is so certain of his horseshit that, on that stage in Osky, he laid out a remarkable future scenario of him in the Oval Office that was essentially one enormous lie that hasn’t had the chance to become a lie yet. Here now is what President Trump would do if Ford tried to build a manufacturing plant down in Mexico:\n\n“It’s so easy. *It’s too easy*. I do it with a phone call. I call the head of Ford, and I say, ‘Every single car and truck that comes into the US, we’re going to tax you 35 percent’.”\n\nMassive applause! Trump wasn’t done.\n\n“So this isn’t 99.9 percent—this is *one hundred percent* what’s going to happen: He’ll call me back, probably that afternoon, but he may play it tough and call me back the next day. The next day I’ll get a call from Ben Ford”—NOTE: there is no Ben Ford; I assume he meant Bill—“and he’ll say, ‘Mr. President, we decided not to build that plant. We’ll build it in the United States.’” \n\nAnd everyone in the joint bought it! They damn near broke their hands clapping for this idea! I almost bought it myself! At least, I did for half a second before I thought, *Wait, don’t you need Congress to approve shit like that? And wouldn’t forcing the plant to be built here increase the cost of Fords? And then wouldn’t people stop buying Fords? And then wouldn’t Ford go belly up, costing us even MORE jobs than if we had just left the goddamn plant in Mexico? And what about the many, many Fords that are already produced in Mexico?*\n\nBut a Trump rally isn’t about thinking more than half a second ahead. There is a first BOLD step, and then you are left to assume that everything else will fall neatly into place. In Trump’s white-trash, Louis XIV universe, all you see is the pretty gold paint before it starts chipping off the walls. \n\n\n----------\n\n\nMoney, ironically, is what will likely wind up being Trump’s political downfall. Once the primary field has been winnowed down to a few schlubs, the GOP establishment will dump its funds into a single candidate with the goal of overtaking Trump, whom they all despise. (Yet one more reason why voters here love him, by the way.) And as rich Trump may claim to be, there are limits to how much of his personal fortune he’ll spend on this effort. \n\nOnce the GOP muscles him out, Trump may very well run a third-party campaign that divides conservative voters and all but hands the 2016 election to a waiting Hillary Clinton. In Osky, this was every thinking Trump voter’s nightmare scenario. “As long as he doesn’t split parties, I’m there,” one attendee told me. “If he does that, it’s too important of an election.” But it could happen. And if it does, Trump may go from the darling of far-right conservatives voters to their most-hated nemesis.\n\nAt the end of Trump’s speech, “We’re Not Gonna Take It” by Twisted Sister boomed through the speakers and played him off the stage.  The crowd grave him a standing O on his way out. The ride was over. The reviews outside were glowing: “Awesome.” “I loved his demeanor.” “Solutions.” “It’s nice to hear somebody talk who’s not a politician.” They were all sold. They were all going to home to preach the gospel of their King Midas.\n\nAs I watched everyone file out, I thought of a moment during Tana Goertz’s opening-act speech earlier in the day, when she pleaded with everyone to eat more of the food outside. “Mr. Trump can’t take all this food home on the plane,” she told us. “There’s not enough room.” And so as all of Trump’s energized constituents filed out of the joint, I pictured him getting onto his plane, cigar in the corner of his mouth, jetting back to the Land of Winners. And I pictured everyone else stuck back here in Osky, with nothing but the scraps he left behind for all the quiet people.","channel":"News & Culture","subChannel":"Politics","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"identifiable":true,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"revisionAuthor":"Freddie Campion","issueDate":"","hed":"What Kind of Person Would Vote For Donald Trump?

He couldn’t always harness it. He couldn’t stop trying to win everyone over, whether it was a *60 Minutes* correspondent, 500 powerful donors in a crowded banquet hall, or a fetching woman on a rope line.\n\n\nIf Clinton acted like someone who ran Capitol Records, Obama—both the person *and* the president—carries himself like Roger Federer, a merciless competitor who keeps coming and coming, only there’s a serenity about him that\ndisarms just about everyone. At one point during the hour I spent interviewing him at the White House this fall, he casually compared himself to Aaron Rodgers, and he wasn’t bragging. Obama identified with Rodgers’s ability to keep his focus downfield despite all the chaos happening in front of him. That’s Obama’s enduring quality,\nand (to borrow another sports term) this has been his “career year.”\n\n+++inset-right\n\n[#image: /photos/56461af26ff00fb522b08a6a]||||||\n\n+++\n\n\nObama lives in America’s most famous museum and uses it to his advantage. You’re sitting there in some ancient tearoom waiting for him to show up, surrounded by portraits of former first ladies and framed maps from battles\nthat America won over the centuries. Everyone is friendly but suspicious. Everyone talks in hushed tones. You feel like you’re intruding at all times. You’re just…waiting. Suddenly, ten anonymous security guards pop out of hallways\nand doorways that you didn’t know were there. The energy shifts. And then, there’s Obama—big smile, big handshake, some ball-busting comments to put everyone at ease. Within seconds of greeting me, he was poking fun at my shoes and teasing me for not writing anymore.\n\n\n“It’s really aggravating not having you on Grantland,” he said, almost like I betrayed him. “I go to the site and there’s no Simmons. Come on, man, it’s not the same.”  \n\n+++aside\n\n> “It’s really aggravating not having you on Grantland,” he said, almost like I betrayed him. “I go to the site and there’s no Simmons. Come on, man, it’s not the same.”\n\n+++\n\n\nIt’s an alpha-male trick—put someone off-balance, flatter them and bust their chops at the same time. A few minutes later, he was grabbing control of the interview with measured responses, knowing that he didn’t have to perform\nwithout cameras or podcast equipment. And so he took his time. And it worked. I mean, how do you interrupt the most powerful man on earth? It felt like the way Federer repeatedly jumped Novak Djokovic’s second serve in the 2015 U.S. Open Final—a savvy trick to disrupt someone’s flow, a seemingly harmless way to gain an edge. It’s what the great competitors do.\n\nIn January, Obama will begin his eighth and final year on the job. It’s an *era* now. What has he learned about leadership? What was his biggest regret? Why did it seem like, in 2015, he finally started letting it fly, threw on his Beefsquatch costume and let everyone know “THIS IS ME NOW!” Gay marriage, health care, Charleston, the Iran deal… If you voted against him, 2015 was the year when his inner confidence bothered you more than ever. And if you voted for him, 2015 was definitely the year when you said, “*That* is the guy I voted for.” But what if Barack Obama has been that guy all along?\n\n\n----------\n\n\n__BILL SIMMONS: If you could go back to 2008 and tell yourself one thing, what would it be?__\n\n__BARACK OBAMA:__ “You’re going to be busy.” Coming in, we were going through an unprecedented economic upheaval, combined with an upheaval in the Middle East that we hadn’t seen in our lifetimes. There was going\nto be a huge amount of disruption. I would probably tell myself to communicate more effectively early on than I did. We ran a great campaign. It wasn’t as great as it seems in retrospect—there’s always rose-colored glasses but there’s no doubt that we captured the country’s imagination. And somehow in those first two years, I think a certain arrogance crept in, in the sense of thinking as long as we get the policy ready, we didn’t have to sell it.\n\nOne thing I learned through some tough election cycles: You can’t separate good policy from the need to bring the American people along and make sure that they know why you’re doing what you’re doing. And that’s particularly\ntrue now in this new communications era. I think that we were ahead of the curve in 2008 in social media and the Internet and digital communications. When we came into office, instead of taking some of those lessons, we\nsuddenly adapted ourselves to the White House press room and structures that had been built back in the 1940s and ’50s. As a consequence of those missteps early, we got the policies right, and that’s why the economy now has grown for five and a half straight years, six years, and why unemployment rates have gone from 10 percent to 5.1 percent. But there was a lot of political pain along the way that might not have been necessary.\n\n\n__Was there a point in those first three years where you started to feel overwhelmed by the job? Where you\nwere just like, “My God, I just had no idea this was going to be this hard!”__  \nI had a pretty good handle. One thing I learned during the campaign was that I’ve got a good temperament. I don’t get too high and I don’t get too low. I’m able to stay focused even when there’s a lot of stuff going on around me.\n\n+++aside\n\n[#image: /photos/564a559f2d2b323920e38094]||||||\n\n+++\n\n__So you’re like Gregg Popovich. Although he does get mad at sideline reporters.__  \n*[laughs]* He does. So do I. *[laughs]* Yeah. Or maybe [Aaron] Rodgers in the pocket, in the sense of you can’t be distracted by what’s around you, you’ve got to be looking downfield. And I think that’s a quality that I have—not getting flustered in what’s around me. So there was never a point, even early on—even in the first six months, where we weren’t sure whether we were going to dip into another Great Depression, we weren’t sure whether the steps we were taking on rescuing the auto industry or stabilizing the financial system were going to work—there weren’t moments where I thought, “Sheesh, feels like we’re in over our head.”\n\nBut what I didn’t fully appreciate, and nobody can appreciate until they’re in the position, is how decentralized power is in this system. When you’re in the seat and you’re seeing the housing market collapse and you are seeing unemployment skyrocketing and you have a sense of what the right thing to do is, then you realize, “Okay, not only do I have to persuade my own party, not only do I have to prevent the other party from blocking what the right thing to do is, but now I can anticipate this lawsuit, this lobbying taking place, and this federal agency that technically is independent, so I can’t tell them what to do. I’ve got the Federal Reserve, and I’m hoping that they do the right thing—and by the way, since the economy now is global, I’ve got to make sure that the Europeans, the Asians, the Chinese, everybody is on board.” A lot of the work is not just identifying the right policy but now constantly building these ever shifting coalitions to be able to actually implement and execute and get it done. \n\n+++inset-right\n\n[#article: /articles/563a3466df121979786a2025]||||||\n\n+++\n\n\n__You’re out to dinner with your wife and the phone rings. How many of the people in your life are you like, “Uh-oh, I’ve got to take this”?__  \nMalia and Sasha. *[laughs]* And maybe my mother-in-law. My national security adviser, Susan Rice, and Denis McDonough, my chief of staff. Those are the only people whose call I would take during a date night with Michelle. But the entire White House is full of people who have enormous responsibilities. You can’t do this by yourself. The principle of team building in the White House is really no different than the principle of team building anywhere, on a sports team or a well-run business. Do they put team ahead of themselves? Do you make sure all the pieces fit together? Because just having the best athletes, if they’re knocking heads and nobody’s doing rebounding and everybody wants the ball, it isn’t always going to work.\n\n__Is it fair to say that in 2015, you’ve been like the second-semester high school senior who got into Yale and now is like, “I’m going out tonight—I don’t care if I have a test tomorrow”? All of us were kind of waiting for that guy to show up after he got re-elected. What took two years to get there?__  \nThere’s no doubt that the longer I’m in this job, the more confident I am about the decisions I’m making and more knowledgeable about the responses I can expect. And as a consequence, you end up being looser. There’s not much I have not seen at this point, and I know what to expect, and I can anticipate more than I did before.\n\nI [also] have a case to make now that was harder to make earlier in my presidency. We had confidence, for example, that the economic decisions that we made to stabilize the financial system and pass Wall Street reform and raise\ntaxes on the wealthiest and pass health care—that would have a payoff. But because we had been in such a deep hole, we had to be careful about crowing success when people weren’t feeling it. And it wasn’t really until around 2014 where the attitude of the American people was, “The economy’s improving, I’m feeling better.”\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#image: /photos/564247813cc8fcfe0e19fd2f]||||||\n\n+++\n\n\n__So you feed off that.__  \nYou can make your case without caveats, which, I think, hampered my ability to communicate confidence and optimism to people. You didn’t want people to feel as if you were getting ahead of yourself. It’s a combination of me feeling looser because I’ve just been in this job a long time and have gone through some tough stretches. Not only do you not look like you have any fear, but you actually *don’t* have any fear. And I don’t at this point. The bets we made early on have paid off. Some of it does have to do with luck. \n\nThink about 2013, right after I’d been re-elected: Our goal was to lead with a big push on immigration reform. And then, before the second inauguration has even happened, [the school shooting at] Sandy Hook happens. Which remains, by the way, the worst few days of my presidency. I went up and visited with those families and—you know, Bill, you’ve still got small kids. These are 6-year-olds, right? And you have 20 of them who’ve been massacred. Right away, our focus had to shift to “Is there a way for us to capture this moment to see if we can get over this incredible hump to try to put in place some common-sense gun-safety rules?” And we knew it was a stretch, just because of the politics of Congress and the NRA. But we had to try. \n\nAnd throughout 2013 and 2014, you had a series of events like that—the Snowden disclosures, Ebola, Ferguson, ISIL, and unaccompanied children coming across the borders—all sort of stacked up in a row. None of them individually unsolvable, but given the 24/7 news cycle, they just sort of pile up on each other. Even though, in the midst of this, the economy is improving and we are making real progress on education and health care and energy and so forth, political momentum turns sharply against you. And so we’ve had more than our share of stormy seas, but we’ve navigated the ship well.\n\n\n__When Ferguson happened last year, I was waiting for Obama the Person to come in. But you had to be President Obama. How you handled Charleston this year and Selma—that was Obama the Person. So what happened with Ferguson? Do you wish you had handled that differently?__  \nYou know, the challenge of Ferguson and all issues related to police shootings, race, and the criminal-justice system is that in order to actually get something done, you have to build consensus. Expressing simple outrage without\nfollow-up is often counterproductive. In the case of Ferguson, I’m the attorney general’s boss. If I chime in with a strong opinion about what’s happened, not only do I stand to potentially damage subsequent law-enforcement cases, but immediately you get blowback and backlash that may make people less open to listening. What was different in Charleston was the clarity of what happened—that allowed, I think, everybody to be open to it.\n\n+++inset-right\n\n> “The fact that race has always been the fault line of our society and has always distorted our politics—that is not subject to argument. Part of what you’re looking for is a way not to just vent but to actually move the people.”\n\n+++\n\n\n__Did it take time during the presidency to realize what kind of moments those were?__  \nYes, sometimes it’s feel. Sometimes the circumstances won’t give you a clean statement. The fact that race has always been the fault line of our society and has always distorted our politics—that is not subject to argument. Part of what you’re looking for is a way not to just vent but to actually move the people. I practiced law for a while—a lot of times, hard cases can make bad law. If you have an issue that you want to put forward, you’re looking for the right plaintiff and the right court to appear before. I do think as you go on as president, you get a better feel for this, but you’re not always going to be perfect. When the Trayvon Martin case happened, I had an honest response as a father that I think resonated with a lot of people. When Ferguson happened, there was a gap between how quickly we could pull together a police task force, recommendations. And so in that lag, it feels as if I haven’t spoken to the moment as effectively. I suspect that if I were to do it over again, there might be something I could say that would’ve crystallized it more effectively. But Ferguson—the case itself was tougher because people didn’t know what was going on exactly. In some ways the [Eric] Garner case in New York was clearer because you had on videotape exactly what had happened, and some of the subsequent cases have been more obvious.\n\n+++aside\n\n[#image: /photos/564a559d85e6a68d29af5edd]||||||\n\n+++\n\nOne thing you learn as president is you’re not always going to perform flawlessly and you have to be able to put that out of your mind and then look at the next problem coming down the pipe. If I’m working out in the gym, sometimes I’ll go to NBA Classics and watch some of these old classic games—\n\n__The lack of HD really hurts—you can barely see anybody.__  \nIt’s true—and the graphics at the bottom are terrible. But a thing that you’re reminded of, watching those old Bulls games, is Jordan had some stinker games in the playoffs. But he would get that out of his mind, and then the next moment comes and he’s right there. He could have a terrible game for the first three quarters and then suddenly go crazy the fourth. Or he might miss a free throw, and then the next play is he’s stealing the ball and hitting the game-winning shot. Part of what I try to do—not at the level that Jordan did on the basketball court, but part of what you aspire to as president or any of these positions of leadership—is to try to figure out how to be in the moment, make the best decision you can, know that you’re going to get a bunch of them right, but a bunch of times you’re also not going to get it exactly the way you want it.\n\n__You win the election in 2008, and Twitter is just becoming a thing. Over the course of your presidency, that’s the biggest thing that’s changed. What’s the biggest challenge with all that stuff?__  \nSpeed. You are on 24/7—you have to respond immediately. The job of our office, to keep up and to respond quickly to anything that’s happening but not be consumed by it, is completely different. We’ve been building a digital team inside the White House. \n\n__When did that start?__  \nToo late. That’s an example of something that I would’ve started earlier. That was a lesson that coming out of the first term, I should’ve understood. That’s why we built this team. It’s so interesting watching my daughters. Both are complete ninjas on the phone, right? And they can do things that I don’t even understand—they’re doing it in two seconds. But I even see a difference between Malia, who’s 17, and Sasha, who’s 14. There’s almost a mini-generational gap in terms of Sasha being so connected seamlessly to this smartphone in a way that Malia, who was already a little bit older when it really started to take, is not. \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#image: /photos/56436afea3bd50211a99c42d]||||||\n\n+++\n\n\n__The ability to multitask with 19 different friends at the same time…__  \nYeah. And just the degree to which her social life is so connected to that. So it’s not just having to change how we do business inside the White House to react to stories, but also, how do we tell a story about issues to constituencies that are completely splintered, who don’t watch television in the same way, who don’t watch the news in the same way? In some ways we’re just laying the foundation for what I assume will be the standard practice of future presidents. \n\n__Gun control: You’ve tried to legislate it as much as you possibly could and hit a wall basically in every direction. But the one thing Hillary Clinton has brought up is executive action.__  \nWell, keep in mind that after Sandy Hook, we put forward 23 executive actions. So we haven’t been asleep at the switch in terms of executive actions that we’ve tried. There are maybe a few more that had to be scrubbed by lawyers because, essentially, with every executive action, we can count on it being challenged by somebody in Congress or, in this case, the NRA. We want to make any executive action we take as defensible as possible legally. In the absence of a movement politically in which people say, “Enough is enough,” we’re going to continue to see, unfortunately, these tragedies take place. The main thing that I’ve been trying to communicate over the last several of these horrific episodes is that, contrary to popular belief, Americans are not more violent than people in other developed countries. But they have more deadly weapons to act out their rage, and that’s the only main variable that you see between the U.S. and these other countries. \n\n__It does feel like it’s going to become the dominant issue of year eight.__  \nI hope so. We have this weird habit in this culture of mourning and, you know, 48, 72 hours of wall-to-wall coverage, and then…suddenly we move on. And I will do everything I can to make sure that there’s a sustained attention paid to this thing. \n\n__What’s the most entertaining conspiracy theory you ever read about yourself?__  \nThat military exercises we were doing in Texas were designed to begin martial law so that I could usurp the Constitution and stay in power longer. Anybody who thinks I could get away with telling Michelle I’m going to be president any longer than eight years does not know my wife.\n\n+++inset-right\n\n[#image: /photos/56424783a3bd50211a99bd4d]||||||\n\n+++\n\n\n__Have you ever said, “Give me the JFK-assassination files, I want to read them. Give me all the secret stuff”?__  \nI gotta tell you, it’s a little disappointing. People always ask me about Roswell and the aliens and UFOs, and it turns out the stuff going on that’s top secret isn’t nearly as exciting as you expect. In this day and age, it’s not as top secret as you’d think.\n\n__Would you ever want to be a Supreme Court justice?__  \n*[pauses]*\n\n__You paused!__  \nNo—well, the reason I paused for a second was just to make sure that I let people know that I think good judges are really important, and Supreme Court justices, obviously, are hugely important. I don’t have the temperament to sit in relative solitude and just opine and write from the bench. I want to be in the action a little bit more. \n\n__Is it true you have a virtual driving range in the White House?__  \nTrue.\n\n__It’s in the bowels of the White House?__  \nYeah, I mean, this is not like some super-fancy thing. But I can hit these Wiffle balls.\n\n__So you go down there and hit, like as a stress reliever?__  \nYeah. Just whack ’em. Whack ’em around a little bit.\n\n__Has anyone come to the White House and picked up your older daughter for a date?__  \nNo, but I’ve seen some folks glancing at her in ways that made me not happy.\n\n+++aside\n\n[#image: /photos/564cb6fc28d382f252281a7c]|||__[Subscribe to GQ](https://subscribe.gq.com/subscribe/gq/96554)__|||\n\n+++\n\n__Tell the Secret Service, “Just take out that guy over there”?__  \n“Just keep an eye on him.”\n\n__Does it scare you that your wife could have a billion-dollar daytime talk show and you could be Stedman 2.0?__  \n*[laughs]* Uh…\n\n\n__Because that’s in play. She could do that if she wanted.__  \nAnd if that’s what she wants to do, I’m okay with her making a whole lot of money. There’s nothing wrong with that.\n\n\n__Would you ever want to be part of the ownership for an NBA team?__  \nAbsolutely.\n\n__Would it have to be the Bulls, or would it have to be somebody else?__  \nWell, you know, I know [Jerry] Reinsdorf pretty good—he’s not giving that thing up anytime soon. But I have fantasized about being able to put together a team and how much fun that would be. I think it’d be terrific.\n\n\n\n__How many times have you said to your kids, “Stop Googling me”?__  \nI don’t have to tell them that. They have no interest in me. I mean, they’re hopefully interested in me as a father. \n\n\n\n__Not as a public figure. What’s your guiltiest-pleasure TV show? Don’t say *Game of Thrones*, because that’s a good show.__    \nProbably the guiltiest pleasure—and this is kind of lame—is *Big Break*. You know, on the Golf Channel? Which is kind of a silly show. *[laughs]* But I find it really relaxing.\n\n+++aside\n\n> “Probably the guiltiest pleasure—and this is kind of lame—is *Big Break*. You know, on the Golf Channel? Which is kind of a silly show. *[laughs]* But I find it really relaxing.”\n\n+++\n\n\n__So you watch it on the treadmill or something?__  \nYeah, when I’m working out sometimes late at night. I never see all the episodes, but if they’ve got some chipping contest or something… *[laughs]* It’s pretty lame. I do love *Game of Thrones*.\n\n\n__Which character do you identify with?__  \nMy favorite character is probably…the dwarf, what’s his name?\n\n__Oh, yeah. Peter Dinklage’s character.__  \nThe problem with *Game of Thrones,* though, is that I don’t remember the names of any of the characters.\n\n__I don’t, either.__  \nI remember the characters, so when I watch it, I know exactly what’s going on. But if you read a review of the show afterwards and they’re mentioning such and such, the only one I remember is Jon Snow, because I can pronounce Jon Snow.\n\n__Which *Game of Thrones* character is Donald Trump?__  \nUh…I don’t think…I don’t think any of them rise to that level.\n\n__If you were campaigning against Trump, would you even bother? Would it be like LaBradford Smith talking trash to Jordan or something?__  \nI would’ve enjoyed campaigning against Trump. That would’ve been fun.\n\n__Which leadership style suits your vision of where America should go forward? Biden or Hillary?__  \n*[laughs]* Come on, Bill.\n\n+++aside\n\n\n[#image: /photos/564a559c85e6a68d29af5ed9]||||||\n\n+++\n\n\n__I had to ask you one thing you can’t answer! Here’s one you have to answer: Who’s more untradable, Derrick Rose or Jay Cutler?__  \n*[pause]* Oh, I think Rose still has more upside. Remember, Rose is still awfully young.\n\n\n__So you haven’t given up on Rose?__  \nI’ve not given up on him. Sadly, I think it’s hard to imagine, after that many injuries, him getting back to his MVP-season performance. But he can still be a top-ten point guard.\n\n\n\n__Baseball, football, basketball, all the commissioner jobs open up next year. Which one would you want?__  \nWell, I’m best suited for basketball. But I cannot believe that the commissioner of football gets paid\n$44 million a year. \n\n__When you said, “I cannot believe…,” I didn’t know where you were going with that. Have you thought about calling [Roger Goodell](https://www.gq.com/story/roger-goodell-season-from-hell) and being like, “What are you *doing?* Can I help you?” [*Obama laughs*.] “Can I give you some advice? Want to have dinner?”__  \nThey’re making a profit, and I think that’s what the owners are most concerned with.\n\n+++inset-right\n\n[#image: /photos/56424783a3bd50211a99bd51]||||||\n\n+++\n\n\n__So you think the owners like having him there?__  \nYou’re not going to drag me into your fights, man. Come on—I’ve got enough fights of my own. *[laughs]* This is between you and Roger.\n\n__Number of cigarettes you’ve smoked in the White House since you got here?__  \nZero in the last five years. I made a promise that once health care passed, I would never have a cigarette again. And I have not.\n\n\n__What perk of being president are you going to miss the most?__  \nSo the clear answer would be Air Force One: an amazing plane with an amazing crew, they clear out airspace so you don’t have to wait. And you land anytime, you leave anytime. But it may be Marine One, because even post presidency, I may be able to round up a private plane sometime, but it’s tough not to have your helicopter waiting for you. *[laughs]*\n\n__The last time I talked to you, you had one teenage daughter.__  \nNow I have two.\n\n__I’m two years away. Is it better, worse, or the same than what you expected when everybody told you, “Oh, just wait—just wait till they’re teenagers”?__  \nMy daughters are amazing girls. They’re smart, they’re funny. They take after their mom, and Michelle’s done a great job with them. You get these teenage moments—they love you, but what I think really affects you most is they just don’t have time for you. It’s not an active disdain for you. It’s just their calendars start filling up and they’ve got all\nthese friends who are much more interesting.\n\n\n----------\n\nThe 14 Best Photos from the White House Flickr Account\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n[#gallery: /galleries/5646583ea3bd50211a99dc5a]||||||\n\n----------\n\n__Yeah, you’re not the coolest person in their lives anymore.__  \nAnd you just have to let go, you have to acknowledge that if you say to them, “Hey, you want to go watch this movie?” or “Hey, you want to go take a swim at the pool?” “No, sorry, Daddy. I love you, though. See you tomorrow, ’cause I’m spending the night at somebody’s house.” The golden age is between, say, 6, 7, and 12, and they’re your buddies and they just want to hang out. And after that, they will love you, but they don’t have that much time for you. And my understanding is, based on friends of mine who have older kids, is that with a little bit of luck, as long as you’re not so completely annoying during these teenage years, they’ll come back to you around 23, 24, and actually want to hang out with you. But that stretch is painful. The compensation you get for the fact that they don’t have time for you is: Nothing beats watching your children become smarter and cooler than you are. And you suddenly will hear them say something or make a joke or have an insight and you go, \n“Wow. I didn’t think of that.”\n\n\n__Are they ready for you to be the ex-president?__  \nNot as much as Michelle, but certainly ready.\n\n__Oh, Michelle’s the leader of the power rankings?__  \nOh, absolutely. There are clear rankings. Michelle. Malia and Sasha, they’re constantly wrestling for second place. I rank ahead of the dogs.\n\n+++inline-video\n\n[#cnevideo: /cnevideos/564a654a64b2c22534d56e6a]||||||\n\n+++\n\n----------\n\n\n__Bill Simmons__ *is the founder of Grantland, the co-creator of

data-reactid="144">One day you’re just a smiley PR lackey; the next, you’re a major operative in the nuttiest campaign in decades. Such is the strange year in the life of Hope Hicks, the 27-year-old accidental press secretary for Donald Trump. How did she get here? And how much longer can she last?</p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid="145"><div class="embed callout-embed-component dropcap " data-type="callout"><p>From the antechamber to Donald Trump&apos;s office on the 26th floor of Trump Tower, I was fetched by Hope Hicks. She was apologetic for the wait and a little nervous about what I&apos;d come to discuss&#x2014;namely, her.</p>
</div></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="146"><p>The 27-year-old press secretary was clad in a teal dress, and she dug her stilettos into the colorless carpet as she showed me into the office, a room festooned with enough Trump memorabilia to suggest a serial killer&apos;s shrine. There before me sat Trump himself, behind his giant desk, upon which there was nothing resembling a computer, a PalmPilot, or even an Etch A Sketch.</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="147"><p>&#x201C;Oh,&#x201D; Trump said, flashing his notorious disdain for handshakes as I extended my arm. He stood and reached, Martian-like, for my hand, as if the ritual were not the habit of businessmen or politicians. Hicks, meanwhile, settled into a $5,000 red velvet Knoll lounge chair. She affixed a smile to her face, and then said nothing more to me. As if speaking were not the habit of a spokesperson. But then, Hicks&#x2014;who never appears on TV and rarely talks to reporters&#x2014;resembles a traditional political spokesperson about as much as Trump resembles Mister Rogers.</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="148"><p>Hicks is a product not of Washington but of the Trump Organization, a marble-walled universe where one&apos;s delightful agreeability and ferocious loyalty are worth more than conventional experience. She is a hugger and a people pleaser, with long brown hair and green eyes, a young woman of distinctly all-American flavor&#x2014;the sort that inspires Tom Petty songs, not riots. And yet Hicks has, almost by accident, helped architect the strangest and least polite campaign in modern American history.</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="149"><p>I wanted Hicks to help me understand just how all this had come to pass, how a person who&apos;d never worked in politics had nonetheless become the most improbably important operative in this election. But she declined my request to talk. Instead, she arranged something more surreal: I could talk <em>about</em> her with Donald Trump, in <em>front</em> of her.</p></div><div class="embed callout" data-reactid="150"><div class="embed callout-embed-component inset-right " data-type="callout"><div class="embed article" id="571e962846f014b90abc2937" data-type="article"><div class="embedded-article-title-hed">EDITOR&#x2019;S PICK</div><div class="embedded-article-container"><a class="embedded-article-image-link" href="/story/melania-trump-gq-interview"><div class="embedded-article-image component-rendition" data-aspect-ratio="1:1" data-component="Rendition"><div class="component-image pending" data-component="Image"><img alt="Melania Trump on Her Rise, Her Family Secrets, and Her True Political Views: &#x201C;Nobody Will Ever Know&#x201D;" src="https://media.gq.com/photos/57210cb70b5c36b80bc2d447/1:1/w_100,c_limit/melania-1x1.jpg"></div></div></a><div class="embedded-article-meta"><a class="embedded-article-rubric-link" href="/news-culture"><div class="embedded-article-rubric">News &amp; Culture</div></a><a class="embedded-article-title-link" href="/story/melania-trump-gq-interview"><div class="embedded-article-title">Melania Trump on Her Rise, Her Family Secrets, and Her True Political Views: &#x201C;Nobody Will Ever Know&#x201D;</div></a></div></div></div></div></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="151"><p>Trump, of course, has little experience with subjects other than Trump, which he made clear when I asked him about Hicks&apos;s quick ascent to his inner circle. &#x201C;Bill O&apos;Reilly last night said it is the greatest political event in his lifetime,&#x201D; Trump said, exaggerating O&apos;Reilly&apos;s point. &#x201C;The most incredible political event in his lifetime! That&apos;s pretty big. You know, who knew this was going to happen? So&#x2026;&#x201D; He pivoted, reluctantly, to the topic at hand. &#x201C;Hope&apos;s been involved from the beginning, and she has been absolutely terrific.&#x201D;</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="152"><p>Hicks&apos;s job&#x2014;a sui generis role of outsize importance that she half invents on the fly&#x2014;involves keeping the media at bay and operating as Trump&apos;s chief gatekeeper. But she&apos;s also summoned in critical moments of confusion to play instigator and score-settler. It was her job to facilitate Trump&apos;s rebuke of the Pope after His Holiness questioned the Christianity of anybody who would build a border wall (kind of Trump&apos;s thing). And it was she who helped malign a female reporter who&apos;d been manhandled by Trump&apos;s campaign manager, immediately claiming she was a lying attention hound. Hicks was also called on this spring to explain why Trump, over the course of three days, advocated four positions on abortion. She tried without success to quell the confusion, declaring, finally, that President Trump would end abortion, simple as that: &#x201C;He will change the law through his judicial appointments and allow the states to protect the unborn.&#x201D;</p></div><div class="component-lazy pending" data-component="Lazy" data-reactid="153"></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="154"><p>Still, for all the grenades Hicks has to both jump on and lob, it&apos;s a more quotidian skill set that seems to impress the boss. &#x201C;If you see her phone going&#x201D;&#x2014;he raised both hands and mimicked Hicks answering several devices&#x2014;&#x201C; &#x2018;This is Hope. This is Hope. This is Hope.&#x2019; &#x201D; He hung up the make-believe phones. &#x201C;She gets a call a minute, probably,&#x201D; he said, seemingly pleased with this antiquated barometer of his own popularity.</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="155"><p>If Hicks is not much like a conventional press secretary, well, that&apos;s all the better for Trump, who hasn&apos;t ever wanted one. &#x201C;He&apos;s always been good at being his own spokesman,&#x201D; Howard Rubenstein, the New York publicist who represented Trump in times of tumult, told me. (Rubenstein might have been speaking literally. In the &apos;80s and &apos;90s, Trump reportedly employed flacks called &#x201C;John Barron&#x201D; and &#x201C;John Miller,&#x201D; spokespeople who&apos;d phone reporters, sounding suspiciously like Trump.)</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="156"><p>Of course, a central component of Trump&apos;s appeal is his lack of political experience, which he advertises as proof that once in office, he will do things differently, and better. Similarly, Hicks, a registered but dispassionate Republican since 2008, had never so much as volunteered on a campaign. So I asked Trump if he viewed her outsider status as an asset, much as he did his. &#x201C;No, I don&apos;t think there&apos;s a benefit to that,&#x201D; he said flatly and frankly, &#x201C;but she was able to build political experience quickly. She was very natural. She was very natural when it comes to picking it up, and a lot of people can&apos;t pick it up, because it&apos;s so fast-moving. It&apos;s faster-moving than anything else. You know, for real estate, you have two days to get back. This <em>thing</em>&#x201D;&#x2014;by which he meant campaigning to lead the free world&#x2014;&#x201C;you have, like, four seconds before the story goes blasting out.&#x201D;</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="157"><p>As Trump prattled on about the crazy-making swiftness of it all, it wasn&apos;t hard to imagine the idea resonating with Hicks, now blushing. The speed with which your whole life can spin&#x2014;it has to be disorienting. I looked at Hicks, trying to ascertain a reaction, but her face was buried in her hand. And it was clear, just then, that to wonder what Hicks has gotten herself into is to wonder something similar about ourselves.</p></div><div class="embed hr" data-reactid="158"><hr></div><div class="embed callout" data-reactid="159"><div class="embed callout-embed-component dropcap " data-type="callout"><p>Hicks&apos;s big job in politics started&#x2014;not that long ago&#x2014;with a comparatively tiny gig in Trump Tower. In 2012, two years after she&apos;d graduated from Southern Methodist, Hicks was working for a New York PR shop when she was dispatched to help one of the firm&apos;s major clients: Ivanka Trump.</p>
</div></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="160"><p>At the time, Trump&apos;s daughter was expanding her fashion line, and Hicks was enlisted to pitch in&#x2014;and even do a bit of modeling, appearing online in a practical mint-colored dress, black clutch, and heels, all from the Ivanka Trump collection.</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="161"><p>Hicks grew close to Ivanka and began dressing like the heiress, who seemed worthy of the emulation. Ivanka was that rare female corporate leader who is also kind to other women, and she affected an air of competence that seemed to temper the boorishness of the Trump brand. Conveniently, as Hicks ingratiated herself to Ivanka, she won over The Donald as well&#x2014;helped by the eager-to-please disposition she&apos;d displayed since childhood.</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="162"><p>In Greenwich, Connecticut, as a kid, she was an athlete and a model who&#x2014;after appearing in a Ralph Lauren ad&#x2014;told a local magazine she intended to be an actress. By high school she was swimming, rowing, and captaining the lacrosse team. (She&apos;d go on to play on SMU&apos;s club team.) Kylie Burchell, Hicks&apos;s lacrosse coach, recalled her as one of the only players to abide by a no-alcohol policy. &#x201C;I think the girls were annoyed at her a little bit,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;She was trying to be a leader. She was showing by example what to do.&#x201D; She wasn&#x2019;t always so earnest, however. In her senior yearbook, she mistakenly attributed the words of Eleanor Roosevelt&#x2014;&#x201C;The future belongs to those who believe in the power of their dreams&#x201D;&#x2014;to Jimmy Buffett.</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="163"><p>That Hicks, a pretty young lady from a tony town, would gravitate toward PR after college might have seemed obvious. Warranted or not, the PR Girl has become a kind of stereotype&#x2014;the land-bound stewardess of the aughts. A profession thought to require little more than the ability to walk in a pair of Louboutins and harass people via e-mail. But the sorority-girl caricature wasn&apos;t what Hicks had in mind, or in her pedigree. In addition to her father, Paul, who directed PR at the NFL and now works for the D.C. power firm Glover Park Group, both of Hicks&apos;s grandfathers worked in public relations.</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="164"><p>After meeting Matthew Hiltzik, a New York PR shark, in 2011, Hicks landed a job at his firm. It was here that she began working with Ivanka, putting her in the orbit of The Donald, who was quickly impressed. &#x201C;I thought Hope was outstanding,&#x201D; Trump told me, recalling his decision to tell Hiltzik that he was poaching Hicks to work for him. In Trump&apos;s telling, Hiltzik was powerless to deny him what he wanted. &#x201C;I wouldn&apos;t say he was thrilled,&#x201D; Trump told me, &#x201C;but, you know, we give him a lot of business.&#x201D; (Hiltzik says the parting was amicable all around.)</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="165"><p>So Hicks joined the team at Trump Tower in October 2014, without any idea her new boss intended to become president. Or that she had just signed on to his campaign.</p></div><div class="embed hr" data-reactid="166"><hr></div><div class="embed callout" data-reactid="167"><div class="embed callout-embed-component dropcap " data-type="callout"><p>One day in late January of last year, Hicks was summoned to Trump&apos;s office. There she found Michael Cohen, Trump&apos;s ball-busting attorney, and Sam Nunberg, a nervy political adviser and prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; of Trump confidant Roger Stone. On the speakerphone was Corey Lewandowski, a journeyman operative whom Trump had just hired for a purpose unclear to Hicks.</p>
</div></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="168"><p>To the assembled, Trump said simply: <em>We&apos;re going to Iowa.</em> Hicks must have known that that meant jumping into a media circus that might change her life, though she wondered only one thing, half in jest: What do people wear in Iowa? Soon she was at the Iowa Freedom Summit, fielding media requests and improvising in the role of real-deal political press secretary.</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="169"><p>Within the tight, alpha-male circle of hired guns, Nunberg could sense her unease. A tall, heavyset man with slicked-back hair, Nunberg gifted Hicks a book, <em>Running for Office.</em> He nicknamed his new friend &#x201C;Hopesicle&#x201D; and quickly developed a fondness for her. &#x201C;She was very cute, because she was very anxious at first about all of this,&#x201D; he told me as he sipped a Thai iced tea at a restaurant on the Upper East Side. &#x201C;I joked with her once, like, &#x2018;You&apos;re like my Peggy, like I&apos;m Don Draper.&#x2019; &#x201D;</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="170"><p>In reality, there was plenty of competition for the role of bizarro Don Draper in the Trump gang. Michael Cohen&#x2014;a consigliere of The Donald&apos;s for a decade, with a near-parody Long Island accent&#x2014;told me he didn&apos;t know what to make of the novice Hicks. When he answered my call, he was in the midst of yelling at someone else on his other phone (showing a dexterity with the phone Trump would have appreciated, I&apos;m sure). He described Hicks to me as a &#x201C;sensitive person&#x201D; who &#x201C;takes things personally&#x201D; when it comes to the coverage of her boss.</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="171"><p>Hicks wasn&apos;t expecting to be the press secretary for long. Trips to key primary states came and went with nobody taking her place, though. Just ahead of Trump&apos;s formal announcement in June, Hicks&apos;s ambivalence about her position created drama fit for an episode of <em>The Apprentice.</em> Lewandowski, a short man with a shorter fuse who looks like a cross between Frank Sinatra&apos;s mug shot and Voldemort, would play a starring role.</p></div><div class="embed callout" data-reactid="172"><div class="embed callout-embed-component inset-right " data-type="callout"><div class="embed article" id="564cac2bb25c6bc36ea027ef" data-type="article"><div class="embedded-article-title-hed">EDITOR&#x2019;S PICK</div><div class="embedded-article-container"><a class="embedded-article-image-link" href="/story/best-donald-trump-interview-gq-men-of-the-year"><div class="embedded-article-image component-rendition" data-aspect-ratio="1:1" data-component="Rendition"><div class="component-image pending" data-component="Image"><img alt="This Donald Trump Interview Is the Best.

You&#x2019;re Gonna Love It.</div></a></div></div></div></div></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="173"><p>A 42-year-old operative who&apos;d worked for the Tea Party group Americans for Prosperity, Lewandowski was now the campaign manager. Hicks was told she couldn&apos;t work for both the political and corporate branches of the Trump team. She had to choose: Join the campaign or go back to the kids&apos; floor of Trump Tower. Hicks, who hates to disappoint, nonetheless told Lewandowski he&apos;d have to find a new press secretary, which apparently set him off. &#x201C;He made her cry a bunch of times,&#x201D; Nunberg said. In Nunberg&apos;s telling, Lewandowski said to Hicks, &#x201C;You made a big fucking mistake; you&apos;re fucking dead to me.&#x201D; Lewandowski declined to either confirm or correct Nunberg&apos;s recollection. &#x201C;I don&apos;t recall the specifics of that,&#x201D; he told me. &#x201C;I can say definitively that I don&apos;t recall the specific incident that you&apos;re referring to.&#x201D;</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="174"><p>Hicks reconsidered when Trump told her to stay. As she traveled with him and a tiny band of staffers around the country, things with Lewandowski eventually mended. Meanwhile, Lewandowski was consolidating power. Racist Facebook posts Nunberg had made beginning in 2007 surfaced and prompted his firing. (He trashed everyone from Al Sharpton to Marxist Muslims to Louis Farrakhan.) Nunberg believes it was Hicks and Lewandowski who petitioned Trump for his ouster and drafted a brutal statement that characterized him as a &#x201C;low-level part-time consultant.&#x201D;</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="175"><p>Nunberg still seemed wounded eight months later, when we met. &#x201C;Of course she ratfucked me, which makes me proud,&#x201D; he told me. Nunberg maintains no feelings of warmth for Lewandowski. &#x201C;I literally will suck the fucking blood out of his skull by the time I&apos;m done with him,&#x201D; he said like a screwball gangster. Not long after Nunberg&apos;s firing, his mentor, Stone, left. (Stone says he quit, but the campaign claims he was fired.) The circle was getting smaller, and Hicks, the only staffer without a bald spot or a tough-guy lilt, had apparently learned how to hang on.</p></div><div class="embed hr" data-reactid="176"><hr></div><div class="embed callout" data-reactid="177"><div class="embed callout-embed-component dropcap " data-type="callout"><p>Trump&apos;s campaign headquarters in Trump Tower occupy an old fifth-floor production studio for <em>The Apprentice.</em> The walls are plywood, decorated by lawn signs and cutouts of Trump. For warmth there&apos;s a space heater. Befitting its TV past, the place feels quite literally like the backstage workroom from which the whole Trump Show is produced.</p>
</div></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="178"><p>Getting the most out of the star requires keeping him informed. While Trump nurses an obvious addiction to cable news, the reading that&apos;s put in front of him is largely confined to a topic he already knows well. Every morning, staffers print out 30 to 50 Google News results for &#x201C;Donald J. Trump.&#x201D; He then goes at the sheaf with a marker, making circles and arrows and annotating things he likes or doesn&apos;t like. The defaced article gets scanned and e-mailed to the journalist or the person quoted who has drawn Trump&apos;s attention, under the subject line &#x201C;From the office of Donald J. Trump.&#x201D;</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="179"><p>As for what arrives in Hicks&apos;s in-box, a typical day brings upwards of 250 media requests. Usually, she alone decides who gets in and who&apos;s kept out. But sometimes it&apos;s Trump who plays bouncer for his own private party. &#x201C;She sees the tantrums, and there are tantrums,&#x201D; a source who&apos;s been with Trump and Hicks told me. &#x201C;He reads something he doesn&apos;t like by a reporter, and it&apos;s like, &#x2018;This motherfucker! All right, fine. Hope?&#x2019; He circles it. &#x2018;This guy&apos;s banned! He&apos;s banned for a while.&#x2019; That&apos;s exactly how it works.&#x201D; Hicks plays parole officer to an extensive and expanding blacklist of outlets and reporters (your correspondent once included) no longer welcome at his events.</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="180"><p>While Hicks is often eager to please, she doesn&apos;t mind upsetting the media and harbors no reverence for the civic duties of a free press. When reporters send her questions, she&apos;s often irked&#x2014;convinced they&apos;re playing detective merely to irritate the campaign. She&apos;s seemingly unaware that they might just be vetting a potential United States president. Often she doesn&apos;t respond.</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="181"><p>None of this has earned her many enemies, however. Like Ivanka, Hicks has managed to float above it all. For now. &#x201C;I have always found Hope to be great to deal with,&#x201D; Maggie Haberman of <em>The New York Times</em> told me, &#x201C;especially given the volume of requests she must be getting.&#x201D;</p></div><div class="component-lazy pending" data-component="Lazy" data-reactid="182"></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="183"><p>The demands of her schedule led to a breakup with her boyfriend of six years. And while she technically still lives in Greenwich&#x2014;with her sister, Mary Grace&#x2014;when she&apos;s not traveling on Trump Force One, Hicks stays in New York, in a Trump apartment provided by the campaign.</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="184"><p>Getting cocooned in Trumpville can test one&apos;s psyche or dent one&apos;s reputation. Maybe even put one on a self-destructive streak. In May, Hicks, thinking she was e-mailing Trump strategy notes to a campaign staffer, sent them instead to a reporter. Days earlier, she&apos;d landed in the <em>New York Post</em> after she was spotted on East 61st Street, screaming at Lewandowski. The spectacle was dismissed as an interoffice dispute. Though if that&apos;s to be believed, the emotional scene, as described to me by people who saw it&#x2014;Hicks&apos;s fists balled, her face streaked with tears&#x2014;makes you wonder what the hell goes on in the Trump War Room.</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="185"><p>Outside the campaign, Hicks&apos;s colleagues gossip about whether she&apos;ll regret her heady first brush with politics. &#x201C;She made a choice to work for the most fascist candidate in recent American history,&#x201D; one political spokesperson told me. &#x201C;Everyone who knows her tells her to stop doing this and putting her name on stuff.&#x2026; She is going to regret everything she&apos;s said and done. And I don&apos;t think she knows it yet.&#x201D;</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="186"><p>Hawking golf resorts one day, Mexican-border walls the next, could Hicks have guessed what her job would become? The gig she signed up for called simply for the ceaseless execution of one man&apos;s whims. And she did it with such aplomb that maybe she didn&apos;t notice that while the directive never changed, the stakes sure had.</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="187"><p>When I sat with Trump in his office&#x2014;a few days before he locked up the nomination&#x2014;I asked him if she would someday serve in a Trump administration. &#x201C;Oh, yeah, sure,&#x201D; he said, deciding on Hicks&apos;s future while she smiled silently and helplessly beside me. &#x201C;In either capacity, either there, or she&apos;ll stay here, but, uh,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;I think she wants to go there.&#x201D;</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="188"><p><strong>Olivia Nuzzi</strong> <em>covers politics for The Daily Beast.

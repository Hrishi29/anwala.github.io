Shortey, a former Oklahoma state senator who last year served as Donald Trump's campaign chair in the state, was meticulous about keeping up his reputation as a pious man, according to several fellow Oklahomans. That reputation, however, has all but disappeared. According to Shortey's attorney, the former Republican lawmaker will plead guilty to one count of child sex trafficking on Nov. 30.</p><figure class="_3jvnrUdBzzciqbdDNc72hX DEdHwdatmchBy2p0SVggY bhq_VSwN8mlY40hZK4tid"><picture class="_1sY8sVdb57K64rzlUznfKp"><source srcSet="https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_47/2233501/171120-ralph-shortey-mn-1200_e96e52a23af8718ea7a446fe2ba0bddc.fit-360w.jpg" media="(min-width: 1000px)"/><source srcSet="https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_47/2233501/171120-ralph-shortey-mn-1200_e96e52a23af8718ea7a446fe2ba0bddc.fit-324w.jpg" media="(min-width: 758px)"/><img src="https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_47/2233501/171120-ralph-shortey-mn-1200_e96e52a23af8718ea7a446fe2ba0bddc.fit-320w.jpg" alt=""/></picture><figcaption class="_1mNthW7mqFJbi97JOX5IHq"> <!-- -->Ralph Shortey is facing felony child prostitution charges after police say he solicited sex from a 17-year-old boy.<!-- --> <span class="_1_nNY9NTCFD3zU0tnwCGFD">Cleveland County Sheriff&#x27;s Office via AP</span></figcaption></figure><p>Shortey, a 35-year-old married father of three, resigned from the state Legislature in March after being charged with several felonies, including engaging in child prostitution, after police found him in a hotel room with a 17-year-old male. Shortey's attorney, Ed Blau, confirmed that his client will plead guilty to a charge of child sex trafficking in exchange for U.S. prosecutors' dropping three child pornography charges against him.</p><div class="Hu6r6bzzUDkhbCzEiWRZD ad-container"><div></div></div><p>"Mr. Shortey feels this is a necessary step in putting this painful and humiliating ordeal behind him, for both himself, his family and for the state of Oklahoma," Blau told <a href="http://newsok.com/shortey-to-plead-guilty-to-child-sex-trafficking/article/5572707" target="_blank">local news site NewsOK</a> on Friday.</p><p>Blau did not respond to NBC News' requests for comment.</p><p>While the age of consent in Oklahoma is 16, child prostitution statutes apply to anyone under 18. Shortey faces a minimum of 10 years in prison on the child sex trafficking charge.</p><p>According to court documents, Shortey and the unnamed teen, referred to as John Doe, connected on Craigslist in or around February 2016. From then until March, the documents state, Shortey "obtained at least one image of John Doe's penis." Then, on or around March 8, the teen messaged Shortey saying, I need money for spring break." The then-lawmaker asked if the teen would be interested in "sexual stuff."</p><div class="Hu6r6bzzUDkhbCzEiWRZD ad-container"><div></div></div><p>Following a tip from John Doe's father, police went looking for the teen at a Super 8 Motel in Moore, Oklahoma, on March 9, at a room rented with Shortey's driver's license and credit card. When officers knocked, Shortey told them he and the teen were getting dressed.</p><p>"When Shortey opened the door, Doe left the room with his backpack, which contained a bottle of lotion," the police report stated. "Inside the room, Moore Police offers found Shortey's backpack. Shortey's backpack contained an open box of condoms and a laptop computer."</p><p>The report also stated Shortey was in possession of child pornography that "depicts a man engaging in sexually explicit conduct with a prepubescent girl."</p><section class="ckdWmnAJHoIhiZsO7x4_c IPpLhq7eaUZFza0H2StCy"><div class="_2I4bAFp1hRBi9q_9mIdOnR"><div class="_3TX1HeDxS7UwMW6acwpaMr"></div><div class="_2VEmeG2TLdYt_gavOBJ-tZ"></div></div><div class="_1wC77p7u75cNhbyPYzygyU"></div><h4 class="_8ePrQgdJyUtiWhWJCNXMI">Related</h4><div class="_3rAuuRrLvEhQ5vvHWo3eay"><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/anti-gay-vandalism-suspected-following-shooting-oklahoma-lgbtq-center-n820731" class="_3ZQ0WYoGk2zFg-wnSws1PR" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="background-image:url(https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_46/2226136/screen_shot_2017-11-14_at_12-33-22_pm_7fdcea2b44927b17b2a31d06131a152f.focal-560x351.png)"></a><div class="_1gYzcQVSkvyeOJszOu2_yP"><h6 class="_2zrCYszVk6Io1Hq0d144TP _2J_-prIANnUShmC9OxXOhh"><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/anti-gay-vandalism-suspected-following-shooting-oklahoma-lgbtq-center-n820731" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anti-gay vandalism suspected in shooting of Oklahoma LGBTQ center</a></h6></div></div></section><p>For LGBTQ advocates in the heartland, Shortey's fall from grace exposed the "family values" politician as a hypocrite.

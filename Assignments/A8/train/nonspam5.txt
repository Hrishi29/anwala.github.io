While Earth Day may be once a year, we’re doing our part every day to take care of our
environment. From our buses to our station and even at our offices, we’re going green.
You may not realize it but you’re helping the environment too when you ride on one of our
buses. Every time our bus leaves a station it takes dozens of cars off the road.
Learn more about our initiatives. Then book your next trip on the most eco-friendly way to
get around!

Less Emissions Than Cars
Traveling on a bus (like a Greyhound), is
actually the smallest carbon footprint of any
mode of transport. (Bikes and walking
excluded!)

More Eco-Friendly Than
Planes
If you’re thinking about traveling with
Greyhound instead of flying, that’s a good
move, too. Even if there are two of you, you’ll
cut carbon emissions by 55-77% if you travel
by bus (plus, it’s way better for the wallet).
